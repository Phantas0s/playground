## Highlights

* Scala has a pleasant syntax for creating, querying, and traversing maps.
* You need to choose between mutable and immutable maps.
* By default, you get a hash map, but you can also get a tree map.
* You can easily convert between Scala and Java maps.
* Tuples are useful for aggregating values.

## 4.1 Constructing a Map

* Maps are collection of pairs
* Can use -> or parenthesis with comma
    * Alice -> 10
    * (Alice, 10)

## 4.2 Accessing Map Values

* Use () to access maps
    * Analogy with function very close

## 4.3 Updating Map Value

## 4.4 Iterating over Maps

## 4.5 Sorted Maps

* Hash tables use hash code of keys to scramble entries
    * More efficient
    * Never in order
* SortedMap is a balanced tree
    * Keep the order
* LinkedHashMap for visit the keys in insertion order

## 4.6 Interoperating with Java

## 4.7 Tuples

* Useful for functions returning more than one values

## 4.8 Zipping
