## Highlights

* Fields in classes automatically come with getters and setters.
* You can replace a field with a custom getter/setter without changing the client of a class—that is the “uniform access principle.”
* Use the @BeanProperty annotation to generate the JavaBeans getXxx/setXxx methods.
* Every class has a primary constructor that is “interwoven” with the class
* definition. Its parameters turn into the fields of the class. The primary
* constructor executes all statements in the body of the class.
* Auxiliary constructors are optional. They are called this.
* 5.1 Simple Classes and Parameterless Methods
