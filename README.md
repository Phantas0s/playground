# Phantas0s' Playground

Hello and welcome to my personal playground!

This place is a bit the courtyard of my [Alexandria Library](https://github.com/Phantas0s/alexandria-library), where I practice what I'm learning. 

It's mostly exercises or [code I copy from a book to learn new languages](https://thevaluable.dev//how-to-learn-programming-language/).

Most of the playground takes the shape of countless sheets of papers I write on, when I revisit my mindmaps or I do some exercise I can't do on my computer (when I need some weird mathematic notation, for example).
