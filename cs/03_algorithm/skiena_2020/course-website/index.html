<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Lecture notes from 
<a href="current-lectures/">current semester</a>.


<li>
Video and audio lectures with links to lecture notes from previous offerings
of my course are available at
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh27N8m4Jp_rkwx26Q4iclQ">my YouTube channel</a> or
<a href="./videos">

<!--
The lecture slides are available from <a href="http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/">
http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/</a>.
-->
The associated lecture notes from these old offerings are available
<a href="oldlectures/">here</a>.

<!--
<li>
Even older lecture notes from previous semesters are available
in <a href="notes/">HTML</a>,
<A HREF="notes/all.ps">
postscript</A>
and
<A HREF="notes/all.pdf">pdf</A>
formats.
The complete set is 300 pages -- do not print them on departmental machines!
-->

<li>
There is a <a href="http://www.algorist.com/algowiki">Wiki</a>
with possible solutions to odd numbered problems from the book.

<li>
Adam Conrad wrote an <a href="https://www.adamconrad.dev/tag/algorithms/">extensive set of blog posts</a> based on auditing my
algorithms course via video.
These notes include Javascript implementations of algorithms and
might be helpful to those learning the material.

<!--
<P>
An excellent way to impress the Prof would be for someone to volunteer
to moderate the Wiki to eliminate spam (not necessarily wrong answers).
This involves getting mediawiki privileges, and figuring out
ccount settings to minimize this.
Spam from writable web sites (like Algowiki) are primarily about adding
links to spam sites (gives them page rank for web search algorithms).
-->


<!--
<li>
Lecture notes from previous semesters
with <a href="http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/lectures-good/">audio</a>
and (maybe, but probably not)
<a href="http://moon.ams.stonybrook.edu/courses99/cse373/default.html">video</a>
are available online!

<li>
Full-lecture 
<a href="http://www.algorithm.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse373/">audio</a>
from Fall 2004 is also available, although they are not keyed directly to
the lecture notes.
