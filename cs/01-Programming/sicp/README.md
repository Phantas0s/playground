# WAT?

This is my attempt to get through of the SICP (at least go through the first 3 chapters)

# Book

The book is [available here](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp)
Online version [here](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml)

# Exercises notation

Each part of the book has its own set of exercise. Each part can have two file: the first one with the first attempt, the second one trying to fix the mistakes after the first attempt.

* **PERFECT** - Solution found the first time with a result very close to the solution.
* **GOOD** - Solution found but with some help or with a result very close to the solution, without being exactly it... but good enough.
* **WRONG** - Exercise tried once with wrong result. If after two times the result is still wrong, the number near will increase for each wrong attempt (example: **WRONG 3**).
* **FIXED** - Exercise **WRONG** the first time and retried some time later with good result (results in \*-2.md files). The number attached to it is  be the number of attempts before it has been fixed.

* **SKIPPED** - Skipped 'cause I have no clue how to do it, or I spent too much time on it. I will put the number of minutes for the second case.
