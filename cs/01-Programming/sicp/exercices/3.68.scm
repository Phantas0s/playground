; Louis Reasoner thinks that building a stream
; of pairs from three parts is unnecessarily complicated. In-
; stead of separating the pair (S 0 , T0 ) from the rest of the pairs
; in the first row, he proposes to work with the whole first
; row, as follows:

(define (pairs s t)
  (interleave
    (stream-map (lambda (x) (list (stream-car s) x)) t)
    (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t))))

; Does this work? Consider what happens if we evaluate (pairs
; integers integers) using Louisâ€™s definition of pairs.
