; Exercise 4.7: let* is similar to let, except that the bind-
; ings of the let* variables are performed sequentially from
; left to right, and each binding is made in an environment in
; which all of the preceding bindings are visible. For example

(let* ((x 3)
(y (+ x 2))
(z (+ x y 5)))
(* x z))

; returns 39. Explain how a let* expression can be rewriî€¼en
; as a set of nested let expressions, and write a procedure
; let*->nested-lets that performs this transformation. If
; we have already implemented let (Exercise 4.6) and we
; want to extend the evaluator to handle let*, is it sufficient
; to add a clause to eval whose action is
; (eval (let*->nested-lets exp) env)
; or must we explicitly expand let* in terms of non-derived
; expressions?
