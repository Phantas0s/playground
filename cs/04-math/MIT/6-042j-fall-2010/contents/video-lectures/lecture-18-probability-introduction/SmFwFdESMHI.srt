8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,090
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,540
Drop date is coming up.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,499
So that you didn't do
very well on the midterm,

11
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,206
and you haven't been
doing your homework,

12
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,070
and you haven't been
going to recitation,

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,580
I would strongly
consider drop date.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,820
And you can see your
TAs to get some idea

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,040
of what your grades
are, and what you're

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,410
likely to do if you keep on
giving the same performance

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,400
you've had so far.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,740
Now, today, we're going to
switch gears again and cover

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,577
the last topic for the course.

20
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,160
For the remainder
of the course, we're

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,800
going to talk about probability.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,880
It's one of the most
important subjects in all

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,540
of math or computer science.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,020
In fact, I was at a frat
last night for dinner,

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,550
and they asked me what my
favorite algorithm was.

26
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,340
And I couldn't really think
about my favorite algorithm

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,370
was, but in terms of one of the
most important subjects for you

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,730
to know about, after induction,
it's probably probability.

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,850
It's really important across
math and computer science.

30
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,812
Most of the upper level courses
you take in computer science

31
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,020
are going to use probability.

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,660
They're going to expect
you to know the basics.

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,110
For example, when you're
designing algorithms in 006

34
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,360
or 6046, you're going to
be designing in some cases

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,990
probabilistic algorithms--
algorithms that flip coins

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,910
or generate random
numbers to get the result.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,410
And by using randomness,
they run faster.

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,800
If you're doing software
engineering later,

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,300
you're going to use
probability when

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,950
you analyze system performance
or build hash tables.

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,190
Probability is used
in information theory,

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,590
in coding theory,
in cryptography.

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,150
In fact, our nation's
codes, their security

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,150
depends on
probabilistic analysis.

45
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,580
Because the bad guys
are using probabilistic

46
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,199
algorithms to break
the crypto-system.

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,920
And we'll give an example of
that in another week or so.

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,820
Probability is
obviously important

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,240
if you're doing game theory
or if you like to gamble,

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
really critical in gambling.

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,100
In fact, we're going to analyze
a lot of different gambling

52
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,350
games over the next few weeks.

53
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,710
And for fun, we'll
play some in class.

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,170
In fact, we'll play
one later today.

55
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,010
And it's amazing how often
the intuition is wrong.

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,440
You think the
answer goes one way,

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
and then it's
actually the other.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Probability is important in
the study of fault tolerance.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,090
For example, how
do you figure out

60
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,730
the probability there's going
to be some critical failure that

61
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,120
causes the space
shuttle to crash?

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,990
Or a critical failure that
causes a nuclear plant

63
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,350
to meltdown?

64
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,250
That's done through
probabilistic analysis.

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,780
And we'll do some
examples of that.

66
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,370
Probability comes
up in everyday life.

67
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,112
We just had an election.

68
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,570
And running up to
the election, you

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,780
get all these polls that
say that's so-and-so

70
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,060
is ahead of so-and-so by three
points with a margin of error

71
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,780
of five points.

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,650
So it's a statistical dead
heat, is what they say.

73
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,930
Well, what the heck
does that mean?

74
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,990
In fact, usually they've
got it screwed up.

75
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,156
And we're going to spend
the recitation where you're

76
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:22,880
going to do a margin of
error analysis for a poll,

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,500
and see how many people
do you need to poll to get

78
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,490
a pretty accurate result?

79
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,390
Comes up in the medical studies.

80
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,400
Does cholesterol
cause heart disease?

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,090
Does smoking cause lung cancer?

82
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,410
How effective is a certain drug?

83
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,780
Say you get tested for a disease
and it comes back positive.

84
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,950
Well, there's false positives
and false negatives.

85
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,970
What are the chances you
really have the disease?

86
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,942
So the list goes on and on.

87
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,900
In fact, we're going to
see all these examples.

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,910
We've got eight lectures
and eight recitations.

89
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,020
And there's just no end
of interesting examples

90
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,770
where probability
comes into play.

91
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,920
The bad news is,
probability is probably

92
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,400
the most misunderstood
subject in all of mathematics

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,370
and the sciences.

94
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,750
In fact, Mark Twain
once said, there's

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:23,300
three kinds of lies-- lies,
damned lies, and statistics,

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,210
meaning probability.

97
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,890
Because it's so easy
to lie with statistics.

98
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,750
And we're going to see lots
and lots of examples of that.

99
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,790
In fact, newspaper
articles, you know,

100
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,000
have all sorts of things that
are just horribly fallacious

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,032
based on statistics.

102
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:41,990
And we'll see examples.

103
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,690
In fact, we're going to even
debunk a very famous article--

104
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,920
published research paper--
by some famous computer

105
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,720
scientists at Berkeley.

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,610
Where they got to a conclusion
using a very standard method

107
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,650
you see all the time--
completely fallacious.

108
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,120
And we'll see that.

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,280
So you can think of that
as, I'm going to teach you

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,080
how to lie with statistics.

111
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,380
Even better, how not to be taken
in by incorrect arguments using

112
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,860
probability theory.

113
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,390
Now, at MIT, it's
probably the subject

114
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,910
that most often
trips up students

115
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,760
in their PhD qualifying exams.

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,450
You know, there's no
better way to strike

117
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,109
terror in the heart of a
student then to be sitting there

118
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,650
and ask them a
question while they're

119
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,480
at the board, what's the
probability that foo happens?

120
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,760
It's like panic sets
in when they've got

121
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,060
to do a probabilistic analysis.

122
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,330
And now, MIT PhD
students are good.

123
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,260
You know, they can crank out
the most horrendous calculation,

124
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,880
no problem, come up with really
clever ideas to solve problems.

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,170
But you get into probability,
it gets into trouble.

126
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,070
In fact, even the other
faculty sitting there

127
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,050
start squirming around when
this question's being posed.

128
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,894
You know, and probability
questions are--

129
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,810
and we'll see some
examples today-- are always

130
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,980
the best at faculty
parties, just

131
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,450
can ruin people's whole night.

132
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,366
You know, what's the
probability this happens?

133
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,580
And it's some weird answer.

134
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,130
Now, the strange thing
about this-- well,

135
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,820
first strange thing is that our
human intuition is terrible.

136
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,380
And you will see that.

137
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,960
Your intuition will
be wrong, just the way

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,840
our brains are
created genetically.

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,880
But the good news is that
probability can be very simple.

140
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,880
If you force yourself to just go
to the basic principles-- which

141
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,920
we're going to cover-- and
go through the basic template

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,630
of how to solve a problem--
which we're going to cover--

143
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,370
it is easy, and
you can't go wrong.

144
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,660
The key is forcing yourself
to just actually write it

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,850
down, follow the
basic principles,

146
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,110
and get to the answer.

147
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,969
As opposed to saying, oh, the
answer's that and here's why.

148
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,010
Because it's amazing how
often you'll be wrong if

149
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,620
you just try to rely
on your intuition.

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,730
Now, we're going to start
today our study of probability

151
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,760
with a famous, simple game.

152
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,270
And the game is known as
the Monty Hall problem.

153
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,500
Now, do you all know
who Monty Hall was?

154
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,590
You're probably too young.

155
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,850
Yeah, OK, not many people
know who Monte Hall was.

156
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,530
But back in the 1970s, there
was a very popular daytime TV

157
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,850
show-- a game show--
called Let's Make a Deal.

158
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,090
And it was a great show.

159
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,870
It was the precursor
of Wheel of Fortune--

160
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,240
if you're old enough to
have seen that-- and then

161
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,900
Deal or No Deal after that.

162
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,500
There's always some game
show that's really popular.

163
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,660
Anyway, back in the '70s,
it was Let's Make a Deal,

164
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,132
and Monty Hall was the host.

165
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,340
How many people have ever
heard of Let's Make a Deal?

166
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,214
Raise your hand if you've
ever heard of that.

167
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,630
OK, so it still has some fame.

168
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,460
Good.

169
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,690
All right.

170
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,970
Now, Monty Hall, of
course, was the precursor

171
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,740
of Pat Sajak of Wheel of
Fortune and Howie Mandel,

172
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,410
you know, from Deal or No Deal.

173
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,070
And his assistant
was Carol Merrill.

174
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,620
She was also famous as
the beautiful assistant.

175
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,430
Now, in Let's Make a
Deal, they TV audience

176
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,890
would come dressed
up in wild costumes.

177
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,690
And Monty would go
into the audience

178
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,240
and pick out a contestant
from the audience based

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,620
on how wild their
costume was-- you know,

180
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,910
somebody that would
look interesting for TV.

181
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,440
And what he would do is he'd
buy a piece of the costume--

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,290
maybe their hat or
shirt or something--

183
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,960
and give them $100 for a
piece of their costume.

184
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,370
And then he would say,
hey look, you know,

185
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,340
if you give me back the
$100 I just gave you,

186
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm going to let you have
your choice of what's

187
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,669
behind door number one,
door number two, or door

188
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,730
number three.

189
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,320
Or sometimes it would be box
number one, box number two,

190
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,260
and box number three.

191
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,560
Now, because people have
seen the game show before,

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,620
they knew that behind
one of the doors

193
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,380
was a brand new car or
underneath one of the boxes

194
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,520
was a diamond ring.

195
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,520
And behind the other doors
were goats or donkeys

196
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
or something totally useless.

197
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,010
So one of the three
doors has a big prize,

198
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,930
the other two got nothing.

199
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,790
But because anybody would pay
$100 for a one-in-three chance

200
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,990
at the car, they played.

201
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,820
And they're on national TV.

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,930
So they give the $100 back to
Monty, and they pick a door,

203
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,830
say door number one.

204
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,690
Monty wouldn't open door
number one right away.

205
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,110
What he would do is say, OK,
you're sure you like that?

206
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,792
All right.

207
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,250
Carol, can you
please reveal what's

208
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,490
behind door number three?

209
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,270
So Carol opens up
door number three,

210
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,150
and there's one of the
donkeys sitting there

211
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,920
or a goat sitting there.

212
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,650
Well, now there's
only two doors left.

213
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,500
One of them has the car.

214
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,070
So he'd ask the contestant,
well, you've seen the goat.

215
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,510
There's a car behind
one of the two doors.

216
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,620
Do you want to stick
with door number one?

217
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,260
Or do you want to switch
and get door number two?

218
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,960
And then the audience is
screaming, you know, switch,

219
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,570
stick, you know, door
number one, door number two.

220
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,320
You know, the guy's
wife's there screaming

221
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,840
at him and everything.

222
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,300
You know, he's got to
pick, so he picks one.

223
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,620
And you know, if he picks the
car, well, his wife's thrilled.

224
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,760
They live happily ever.

225
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,559
He's a hero on national TV.

226
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,100
And if he picks the goat, you
know, he's looking at a divorce

227
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,560
and his career's ruined.

228
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,250
So it's pretty important that
he gets the right strategy here.

229
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,380
Now, the question we're
going to look at today

230
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,670
is whether or not
the contestant should

231
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,050
switch, playing this game.

232
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,720
Now, before we do
the analysis, we're

233
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,540
going to actually play
the game in class.

234
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,414
I've got three boxes here.

235
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,330
The game we're going to
play is the same idea.

236
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,300
The prizes are a
little different.

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,470
Instead of a diamond
ring or a brand new car,

238
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,700
we've got $10 Toski's
gift certificates.

239
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,370
You know, your tuition
only goes so far here.

240
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,790
Instead of donkeys
or goats, we've

241
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,871
got something much better, the
ever-popular nerd pride pocket

242
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:00,370
protector.

243
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,230
And just to be
clear, this is not

244
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,590
the prize, the gift
certificate here--

245
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,559
this is much, much better.

246
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,350
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

247
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,890
Now, in terms of Monty
Hall, we don't have him,

248
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,680
but you have me.

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,580
But I am very happy to report
that we're bringing Carol

250
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,530
Merrill out of retirement.

251
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,630
She's coming and making a
special appearance today,

252
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,680
I hope, at 6042.

253
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,882
Do we have Carol?

254
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:31,840
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi, Tom.

255
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,140
PROFESSOR: Oh,
yes, we have Carol.

256
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,186
That's scary.

257
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:37,530
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

258
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,085
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,190
OK.

260
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,340
[APPLAUSE]

261
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,290
As you can see, the years
have not been kind to Carol.

262
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,720
And your tuition only
does goes so far.

263
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,840
Now, we need three volunteers.

264
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,760
We're going to play
the game three times.

265
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
All right, got a couple there.

266
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,690
Why don't you come down?

267
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,180
We've got three volunteers here.

268
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,490
All right, we'll get
the boxes set up.

269
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,090
And Carol, why don't
you set those up

270
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,660
and load them up with-- these
are the gift certificates.

271
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,645
That's the pocket
protector there.

272
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,770
All right, now, don't look.

273
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,590
You've got to get back over
there so you can't see--

274
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,550
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

275
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,730
And no, no, no, now, you've
got the film going, you know,

276
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,070
here we go.

277
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,910
All right.

278
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,810
So Carol is going to put the
prize in one of the boxes

279
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,210
and the pocket
protectors in the other.

280
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,560
Now, I want you all to
be thinking, you know,

281
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,270
what's the right strategy here?

282
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,020
Is it better to switch?

283
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,030
Does it matter?

284
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,960
What are the chances of winning?

285
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
One in three?

286
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,570
One in two?

287
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,930
All right, so who's our
first volunteer here?

288
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,950
All right, come on over.

289
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,741
We're going to write
your name on the board

290
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,590
because we're going to keep
track of what happens here.

291
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,879
What's your name?

292
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,670
TERRANCE: Terrance.

293
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,503
PROFESSOR: Terrance.

294
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,530
All right.

295
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,960
Now, first thing
you've got to do,

296
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,980
Terrance, is pick a box as
your basic choice to start.

297
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,610
TERRANCE: Two.

298
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,260
PROFESSOR: Number two, OK.

299
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,106
All right, you
picked number two.

300
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,070
Hm, interesting choice.

301
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,695
Now, Carol, can you show
him one of the other boxes?

302
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,260
All right, which on was
that you showed there?

303
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,820
You revealed number three.

304
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,832
And what was under number three?

305
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,275
AUDIENCE: Pocket protector.

306
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,718
PROFESSOR: Pocket protector.

307
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:50,185
Oh, God, you may never
live this down, Carol.

308
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:50,685
OK.

309
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,740
Now, Terrance, as you
know, one of these

310
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,280
has the gift certificate.

311
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,300
One of them has another
pocket protector.

312
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,860
And now, you've got
to decide, are you

313
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,470
going to stick with number two,
or are you going to switch?

314
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,239
In fact, class,
you know, Terrance

315
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,030
may need some help
here, figuring this out,

316
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,420
so what do you recommend?

317
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,180
[AUDIENCE  CHATTER]

318
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,630

PROFESSOR: He is
going to switch.

320
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,865
All right, and Carol,
can you reveal his prize?

321
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,710
What did you get?

322
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,000
Ah, he gets the prize.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,320
So he wins.

324
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,650
Very nice, OK.

325
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,200
So you get $10 at Tosci's.

326
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,570
Well done.

327
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,960
Who's next?

got new prizes loaded in there?

the same as last time.

him one of the other boxes,

348
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,660
please?

349
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,820
Carol shows you number two.

All right, Chinua,
what do you think?

351
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,780
Do you want to stick or switch?

352
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,240
Do you want to stick with
three or switch to one?

353
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,203
One had it last time, right?

356
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,246
PROFESSOR: He's going to switch.

357
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:38,700
OK, so that means you
are picking number one.

358
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,130
Carol, can you show
him what he's won?

359
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,416
Another gift certificate.

360
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,919
All right, now, Carol it is
OK to use a different box

361

All right, who's
our last contestant?

365
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,100
What's your name?

368
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,220
That's good.

369
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,970
Oh, yeah, yeah, turn around.

370
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,770
No peeking here.

371
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,250
OK.

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,350
Ty, what's your first choice?

373
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,850
TY: One.

374
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,945
PROFESSOR: Box number one.

375
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:15,500
Yeah, that's been the one with
the gift certificate, for sure.

376
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Carol, can you show
him another box?

377
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,860
Way too many cameras
in this room.

378
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,982

gentlemen, I'd like

you to explain why-- each
in turn, why did you switch?

seemed like the majority vote.

they were talking about, OK.

told that it's more

00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,660

think it helps to switch.

No.

423
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,918
Anything could have
happened with three trials.

424
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,895

statistical inference

00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,610

431
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,410
Well, we've got a couple.

432
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,940
How many people think
it's 50-50 if you switch?

433
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah, a lot.

434
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,250
How many people think it's
worse than 50-50 if you switch?

435
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,990
Not many.

436
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,426
How many people think
it's better than 50-50?

437
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:33,250
Ah, that's I think most of
you there, pretty close.

438
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,090
All right, now, the
answers to these questions

439
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,320
are very easy to work out--
and we're going to do it.

440
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,700
We're going to figure out
the probability exactly--

441
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,960
if you use mathematics.

442
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,500
But it's really
tricky if you try

443
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,490
to use intuition or
hand waving arguments.

444
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,610
Now, for example,
this game-- Carol

445
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,220
wants to leave-- yeah, Carol,
let's give Carol a hand here.

446
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,790
She did a wonderful job.

447
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,526
Well done.

448
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,804
[APPLAUSE]

449
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,249
Yikes.

450
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm going to get in
trouble here, too, now.

451
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,590
You know?

452
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,770
OK.

453
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,710
For example, this game, and
this particular version of it,

454
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,050
was the subject of a series of
articles in Parade Magazine.

455
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,500
This is an old version
of Parade Magazine.

456
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,260
And what I'm going to do is
hand out the series of articles.

457
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,130
And the TAs are going to
help me hand these out.

458
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,580
There was three of them with
a lot of write-ins here.

459
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,724
I'm going to give
you a bundle here.

460
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,859
There you go.

461
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:35,400
There you go.

462
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,707
I'll give the rest to Oscar.

463
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,460
Great.

464
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,030
Now, Marilyn has a column
every week in Parade.

465
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,200
And people write in
questions, usually

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,700
about their love life
and weird things.

467
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,350
And she answers them.

468
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,210
And she's well
qualified to do this

469
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,890
because she's listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records

470
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,350
as having the highest IQ of
a human being ever, at 228.

471
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,100
And so, you know
she's in some sense

472
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,600
qualified to answer any
question that is written in.

473
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,390
Now, in September of 1990-- and
we're passing out the articles

474
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:32,880
now and it shows
the first article--

475
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,700
this guy named Craig
Whitaker writes in and asks

476
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,469
Marilyn if you should
switch in this game.

477
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,510
So you can all read that.

478
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,830
It says, suppose you're on
a game show and you're given

479
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,500
the choice of three doors.

480
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,120
Behind one door is a car.

481
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,180
Behind the others, goats.

482
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,470
You pick a door, say
number one, and the host,

483
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,120
who knows what's
behind the doors,

484
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,910
opens another one, say door
three, which has a goat.

485
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,480
He says to you, do you want
to pick door number two?

486
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,055
Is it to your
advantage to switch?

487
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,670
Now, Marilyn writes back
saying, very plainly,

488
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,070
yes, you should switch.

489
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,880
The first door had a
one-in-three chance of winning.

490
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,530
The second door has a
two-in-three chance.

491
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,320
Here's a good way to
visualize what's going on.

492
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,540
Suppose there are
a million doors.

493
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,780
You pick door number one.

494
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,480
Then the host, who knows
what's behind the doors,

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,710
reveals every other door
but one and 777,777.

496
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,900
Well, it would sort
of look like 777,777

497
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,205
is the one with the car, and
you'd switch pretty fast.

498
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,620
All right that's her argument.

499
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,990
That is not exactly a
proof, OK, that the answer

500
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,450
is you should switch or
that the probability is 2/3.

501
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,270
All right?

502
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,140
Now, because she's
giving another problem

503
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,070
with a million doors, but you've
got a problem with three doors.

504
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,530
And as we'll see in recitation
tomorrow, the number of doors

505
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,980
actually matters in terms
of some strategies here.

506
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,760
So people weren't
convinced by this.

507
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,510
And so, if you look
to the next page,

508
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,930
you see people writing in.

509
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,340
And there's a lot a write-ins.

510
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,830
The first one's by Robert
Sachs, who's actually--

511
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,360
I looked him up on
Google, and he's

512
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,450
on the faculty at
George Mason University.

513
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,390
I also noticed that
in his history,

514
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,400
he got his BA from Harvard.

515
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,130
So that should tell you
something about the quality

516
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,400
of his response here.

517
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,330
He says, since you seem to enjoy
coming straight to the point,

518
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,560
I'll do the same.

519
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,890
You blew it.

520
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,170
Let me explain.

521
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,120
If one door is
shown to be a loser,

522
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,120
that information
changes the probability

523
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,940
of either remaining
choice, neither of which

524
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,210
has any reason to
be more likely.

525
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,340
And so, the answer is one
half of having the car.

526
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,830
Then he says, as a
professional mathematician,

527
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,830
I'm very concerned with
the general public's

528
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,760
lack of mathematical skills.

529
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,545
Please help by
confessing your error.

530
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:07,090
And in the future,
be more careful.

531
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,810
Just a little gratuitous
extra statement there.

532
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,270
Next we've got a PhD from
Florida, Scott Smith, who says,

533
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,600
you blew it, and
you blew it big.

534
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,210
Since you seem to
have difficulty

535
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,350
grasping the basic principles
at work here, I'll explain.

536
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,440
After the host reveals
a goat, you now

537
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,890
have a one-in-two
chance of being correct.

538
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,530
Whether you change
your selection or not,

539
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,150
the odds are the same.

540
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,140
There is enough mathematical
illiteracy in this country,

541
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,560
and we don't need the world's
highest IQ propagating more.

542
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,199
Shame.

543
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,240
Well, now, this guy is
right about that one point

544
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,370
about mathematical
illiteracy in the country.

545
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,290
The next guy, Barry
Pasternack, you know,

546
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,360
he lists himself as California
Faculty Association.

547
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,050
He actually was president of the
California Faculty Association.

548
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,870
He says, your answer to
the question is an error,

549
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,120
but if it's any constellation,
many of my academic colleagues

550
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,080
have also been stumped
by this problem.

551
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,580
OK.

552
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,360
So next page,
Marilyn writes back.

553
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,510
And she says, you
know, good heavens,

554
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,572
with so much learned
opposition, I'll

555
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,030
bet this is going to keep math
classes all over the country

556
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,960
busy on Monday.

557
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,760
And it did.

558
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,910
It was a huge uproar
at the time about this.

559
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,230
So now she tries
to explain it some

560
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,430
more with shells and stuff
under the shells and so forth,

561
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,040
trying to argue it.

562
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,750
And then she says, just try
the experiment six times

563
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,116
or something, and you'll see.

564
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,300
You know, but, it's
not really convincing.

565
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,640
It's not a proof.

566
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,340
She's sort of waving hands at
it to give you some idea of why

567
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,686
she thinks she's right.

568
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,310
But when I look at
the hand waving here

569
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,080
versus the hand waving
on those faculty,

570
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,460
well, it's all hand waving.

571
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,960
All right.

572
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,740
So you go to the next
page, and now the letters

573
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,910
are getting a little nastier.

574
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,670
We got another University
of Florida guy.

575
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,450
He says, may I suggest
you obtain and refer

576
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,860
to a standard textbook
on probability

577
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,720
before you try to answer a
question of this type again.

578
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,380
Then Robert Smith,
Georgia State,

579
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,280
I am sure you will
receive many letters

580
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,780
on this topic from high
school and college students.

581
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,970
Perhaps you should keep
a few addresses for help

582
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,380
with future columns.

583
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,190
These are great.

584
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,525
Now this next guy, Ray
Bobo, now, he's a real guy.

585
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,400
I looked him up, too.

586
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,150
It's not fake.

587
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,820
That's his real name.

588
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,190
And I've got to say,
if my name was Bobo,

589
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,630
I'd think twice before
writing into Parade Magazine,

590
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,070
you know, especially
if I'm wrong.

591
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,080
Anyway, here's Bobo.

592
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,260
You are utterly incorrect
about the game show question.

593
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,170
And I hope this controversy
will call some public attention

594
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,415
to the serious national crisis
in mathematical education.

595
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,394
Well, that's fair.

596
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,810
If you could admit
your error, you

597
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,310
will have contributed
constructively

598
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,091
towards a solution of
a deplorable situation.

599
00:25:58,091 --> 00:25:59,090
Now, here's [INAUDIBLE].

600
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,940
How many irate
mathematicians are needed

601
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,380
to get you to change your mind?

602
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,794
Well that's proof by
intimidation, right?

603
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:08,600
[LAUGHTER]

604
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,420
You know, it's not,
here's the reason why.

605
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,490
It's just, so many irate
mathematicians said

606
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,510
it, they must, must be right.

607
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,550
Now the next guy.

608
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,340
I am in shock that
after being corrected

609
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,110
by at least three
mathematicians,

610
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,300
you still did not
see your mistake.

611
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,880
As if three
mathematicians, that's

612
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,340
sort of the criteria
for correctness.

613
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,190
Oh, this guy is bad.

614
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,970
Maybe women look at math
problems differently than men.

615
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,550
Ooh.

616
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,220
Well, maybe it's a good
thing in this case.

617
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,740
I don't know.

618
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,690
Oh, then we have Glen
Calkins, you are the goat.

619
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,190
Finally, this guy, US
Army Research Institute,

620
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,550
a little scary.

621
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,230
you made a mistake, but
look at the positive side.

622
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,840
If all those PhD's
were wrong, the country

623
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,620
would be in some
very serious trouble.

624
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:01,980
All right.

625
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,620
Now Marilyn writes an
even longer response

626
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,970
because she's getting zillions
of letters, 90% voting

627
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,660
against her, that she's wrong.

628
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,130
She begins now, suggests
a nationwide experiment,

629
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,490
so that, nationwide, you'd
do the sample a million times

630
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,414
and get the answer, which
really wouldn't prove it either.

631
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:22,580
Then we go to the last page.

632
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,630
There's one last letter.

633
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,420
And this is what finished
the controversy in the press.

634
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,350
Comes from MIT.

635
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,590
You are indeed correct.

636
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,110
My colleagues at work had
a ball with this problem,

637
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,280
and I dare say that most of
them, including me at first,

638
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,480
thought you were wrong.

639
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,870
So maybe that $50,000 a year
somebody's paying for education

640
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,260
is worth something, because MIT
came in and agreed with her.

641
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,490
OK.

642
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,650
It turns out that Marilyn
was correct in her statement

643
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,180
that you should switch.

644
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,630
And if you switch, you have
a 2/3 chance of winning.

645
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,050
So if you don't switch, you've
got a 1/3 chance of winning,

646
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,750
provided that
Monty is guaranteed

647
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,285
to open a door with goat.

648
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:07,780
You know and that's
the assumption here.

649
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,720
And the proof is simple.

650
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,270
Although Marilyn's reasoning
wasn't so convincing,

651
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,590
I didn't think.

652
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,500
And all those PhDs that wrote
in with those stupid letters,

653
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,220
they're probably
intelligent people.

654
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,480
After all, they got advanced
degrees in mathematics,

655
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,270
and most of them were
faculty teaching mathematics.

656
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,880
A little scary.

657
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
But they just weren't
following the basic principles.

658
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,600
They were following
their intuition.

659
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,220
They didn't go through
the basic steps

660
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,046
to figure out the probability.

661
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,420
So that's what
we're going to do.

662
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,602
We're going to go
through the basic steps

663
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,140
now and see how to solve it.

664
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,210
And we will use these
steps to solve pretty much

665
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,320
every problem in probability.

666
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,840
OK?

667
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,860
So the key, the first step,
is to look at the sample

668
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,512
space of possible outcomes.

669
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:58,710
Let me define sample
space and outcome.

670
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:13,550
The sample space for an
experiment, or a probability

671
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:22,000
game-- you can treat this Monty
Hall game as an experiment--

672
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,990
is simply the set of
all possible outcomes,

673
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,790
things that could happen.

674
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,660
In fact, let me
define an outcome,

675
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,040
also known as an atomic
event or a sample point.

676
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,790
An outcome, also
known as a sample

677
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:59,470
point-- we'll use those
terms interchangeably--

678
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:21,320
consists of all the information
about the experiment,

679
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,160
including-- and
that's after it's

680
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:42,940
been performed-- including the
values of all random choices.

681
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,330
For example, say we want to
know the probability of winning

682
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,486
in Monty Hall if you switch.

683
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:07,780
All right, let's
figure that out.

684
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,230
So in that case, we're going to
define an outcome of the Monty

685
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:30,740
Hall game or a sample point--
and I'm assuming in this case,

686
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:47,434
we know you're going to switch
and the contestant switches--

687
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:48,475
consists of three things.

688
00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:00,780
First, the box with the prize,
where did Carroll put it?

689
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,735
Second, the box chosen
by the contestant.

690
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,960
And third, the box
that was revealed.

691
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,720
Once you know
those three things,

692
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,150
you know everything
about what happened.

693
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,880
All right?

694
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,450
For example, let's look
at a typical sample point.

695
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:40,330
Say I took sample point,
or outcome, 2,1,3.

696
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:53,490
This is the outcome where
the prize is the box 2.

697
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:09,130
The player picks first box 1.

698
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:16,150
And Carol reveals box 3.

699
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,140
OK, now in this case,
in this outcome,

700
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,205
did the contestant win?

701
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,700
Yes, because we're
assuming-- for henceforth,

702
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,550
for most of the rest
of the day, we're

703
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,230
assuming the switch
case, because we're

704
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,360
going to analyze that.

705
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,860
So that's fixed, they switch.

706
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,470
They come in knowing
they're going to switch.

707
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,900
So the prize is in 2, all right?

708
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,650
The prize is here.

709
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,560
The player started here.

710
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,770
Carol revealed 3.

711
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,370
And when they switched,
they got the prize.

712
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,310
So in this outcome,
the player won.

713
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,950
OK.

714
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,570
Now, does every 3-tuple here
correspond to a sample point,

715
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,601
to our possible outcome?

716
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:06,100
No.

717
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,909
What's an example of a sample
point with numbers 1, 2,

718
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,980
and 3 that's not.

719
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:12,989
Yeah?

720
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,199
Very good.

721
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:27,010
Yeah, so for example, 1,
2, 1 is not a sample point,

722
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,500
is not in the set,
the sample space,

723
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,310
because we can't reveal
the box with the prize.

724
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,060
Similarly, 2, 1, 1 is
not a sample point,

725
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,810
because we can't reveal the
box that the player picked.

726
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,351
Yeah?

727
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,976
AUDIENCE : I think the first two
pieces of data actually define

728
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:54,732
the third one, because
once, or-- actually, no,

729
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:57,210
if they're the same.

730
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,490
PROFESSOR: Right,
so if the player

731
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,321
picked the box with
the prize, which

732
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:04,110
never happened in our case.

733
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:12,460
For example, 1, 1 2 and
1, 1, 3 are both possible

734
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,230
because you could put the prize
here, the player could pick it,

735
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,960
now Carol has a choice
of revealing 2 or 3.

736
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,000
OK?

737
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,790
So these are OK.

738
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:34,030
All right, so let's figure out
a nice way of characterizing

739
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,400
all outcomes in
the sample space.

740
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,920
Now, to do this, we're
going to set up a tree.

741
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,980
And we're going to use
a thing called the tree

742
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:54,679
method to construct
the sample space,

743
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,720
getting all the outcomes.

744
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,360
All right.

745
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,300
So the first thing we do is
figure out where the prize is.

746
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,980
And we'll represent that as
sort of like a decision tree.

747
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,060
There's three choices.

748
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,320
It's in box 1, box 2, or box 3.

749
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,971
Then the next thing is the
box that the player picked.

750
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,640
And we'll continue our
decision tree here.

751
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
Each of these now
has three branches.

752
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,778
And they're labeled 1, 2, or 3.

753
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,030
And then, the last step
is which box is revealed.

754
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,620
Now, in this case, if
the prize is in one

755
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,680
and the player chose one,
there's two possibilities.

756
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,090
We could reveal 2 or reveal 3.

757
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:18,830
So we get 1, 2, 3
here and 1, 2, 3 here.

758
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,880
What about here?

759
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,490
Prize is in box 1, box
2 is revealed-- sorry,

760
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,730
player picked box 2.

761
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,850
Prize is in 1, player picks
2, how many choices for which

762
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,940
box is revealed?

763
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,660
One.

764
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,390
And which box is
going to be revealed?

765
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,870
3.

766
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,900
All right, this is
sample point 1, 2, 3.

767
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,120
And here we've got 1,
3, 2 is the only choice.

768
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,660
All right.

769
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,625
And let's do--
maybe I'll, we ought

770
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,140
to fill the whole
thing out here.

771
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:08,060
2, 1, 3-- I'm going to run out
of space, but-- 2, 2, now this

772
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,110
splits into 1 and 3.

773
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,790
All right?

774
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:23,120
So we have here
2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3.

775
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,420
Now let me do the last
one, 2, 3, 1 here.

776
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,070
And now I'll bring
these up over here.

777
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,135
I've got 3, 1, 2.

778
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,770
Then I've got 3, 2, 1.

779
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,780
And finally, I've got 3, 3
with two choices, 1 and 2.

780
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,150
All right?

781
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,670
That is now the construction
of the entire sample space,

782
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,100
all the possible outcomes.

783
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,850
How many sample
points are there here?

784
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,030
How many possible outcomes?

785
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,690
AUDIENCE : 12

786
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,190
PROFESSOR: 12.

787
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:22,100
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, OK.

788
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,570
Let's see which ones correspond
to victory for the player.

789
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,740
Let's label each one
as a win for the player

790
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,150
or a loss for the player.

791
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,150
What's this one?

792
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,650
Yeah.

793
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,040
Prize is in 1,
the player chose 1

794
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,690
where the prize was, and
then switched away from it.

795
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,300
Loss.

796
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,650
What about this one?

797
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,140
Loss, same reason.

798
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,180
What about this one?

799
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,760
That's a win.

800
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,560
The prize is here, the player
went there and switched,

801
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,520
so they wound up there.

802
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,390
Win.

803
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,050
And these are all wins
for the same reason.

804
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,280
Whoop, not this one.

805
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,080
2, 1, 1, the player got
it right to start with,

806
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,170
and then switched away.

807
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,830
That's a loss.

808
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,470
Loss.

809
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,320
Win, win, win.

810
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,955
And here the player got it
right, they switched away,

811
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,350
it's a lose.

812
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,680
All right, so we've
labeled every outcome

813
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,420
as to whether the player
who's switching wins or loses.

814
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,940
How many sample points
lead to victory?

815
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,780
6.

816
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,590
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of 12.

817
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,420
Uh-oh.

818
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,290
Was Marilyn wrong?

819
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,590
Is it really Bobo was right?

820
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,890
It's 50-50?

821
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,814
Half the sample points
lead to victory.

822
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:46,910
Hm, what's missing here?

823
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,932
Yeah?

824
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:50,360
AUDIENCE : The first
two are identical,

825
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
the box with the prize
and the box chosen first.

826
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,804
Each of those two sample
points coming from that

827
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:59,876
are half as likely as
the single sample points.

828
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:00,876
PROFESSOR: That's right.

829
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:04,060
What we're missing
here is the likelihood

830
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,160
of an outcome, the probability
that this is what happens.

831
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,846
We're missing one more thing.

832
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:11,470
And this is really
critical when you're

833
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,630
making your sample spaces.

834
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,550
You need to make sure you get
the probabilities assigned

835
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,180
to each event.

836
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,650
They're not necessarily
equally likely.

837
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,060
In fact, what we need to do is
to construct the probability

838
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,400
space.

839
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,440
So lets define that.

840
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:44,300
Your probability space consists
of a sample space-- which

841
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,670
we've already talked about.

842
00:41:46,670 --> 00:42:02,140
That's just all these outcomes--
and a probability function

843
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,460
that maps-- and we call
this function, usually, PR.

844
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,500
We'll have, sometimes it'll
be f or something like that--

845
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:21,325
but PR maps the sample
space, S, to the real numbers

846
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:30,220
such that first, for every
outcome in the sample space,

847
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:37,590
the probability is between
0 and 1 of that outcome.

848
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,570
And 2, if you sum
up the probabilities

849
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,870
of all the outcomes, you get 1.

850
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:50,100
So the sum over all outcomes of
the probability of the outcome

851
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,541
is 1.

852
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,040
All right?

853
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,750
So the sample space
is all the outcomes.

854
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,850
The probability space adds
in-- has this extra thing--

855
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,410
the probability of each outcome.

856
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,880
And really, it
could be anything,

857
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,290
as long is the probability
of every outcome

858
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,140
is between 0 and 1 and
they all add up to 1.

859
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,710
That's it.

860
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,690
All right.

861
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,550
Now, there's a
natural interpretation

862
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,090
of what the probability
function is.

863
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,812
And that is the probability
of a sample point,

864
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:22,770
well, should be the
probability of its outcome.

865
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:31,300
And this is sort of where you
get the to Marilyn saying,

866
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,000
hey, try it a million times
and you'll see 2/3 of the time,

867
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,600
roughly, you get the
right, that you win.

868
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,990
So for every outcome,
the probability

869
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,020
of that outcome,
that real number,

870
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:54,000
should be the probability that
when you run the experiment,

871
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,045
w is what happens.

872
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,580
w will be the outcome.

873
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,690
In other words, if
probability of w

874
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,620
were a half, what
that means is you

875
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,670
should get that half the
time, roughly speaking.

876
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,915
We'll get into really
details of that later.

877
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:20,810
In other words, you toss
a fair coin, you flip it.

878
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,260
Well, you might say, a
probability half of a heads.

879
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,760
All right?

880
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,620
And so, this function, then,
the probability of heads is 1/2.

881
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,540
Now, assigning the right
probabilities to the outcomes

882
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,029
is 95% of the work.

883
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:37,570
In fact, if you
screw that up, you're

884
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,517
doomed because you can't
get the right answer.

885
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:42,600
So for example, if we just
said, OK, each of these

886
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,571
is probability 1/12,
we'd get Bobo's answer

887
00:44:46,571 --> 00:44:47,820
as the probability of winning.

888
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,009
So that's not too good.

889
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:53,050
Now, to get the right
probabilities for the Monty

890
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,000
Hall problem, we have to
make some assumptions.

891
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,254
So let's write those down.

892
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,710
So the first assumption
we're going to make

893
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,170
is that Carol put the
prize in a random box.

894
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,740
They're all equally likely.

895
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:44,470
So the prize is in each
box with probability 1/3.

896
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,380
The next assumption
we're going to make

897
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,200
is that the player didn't
see which box has the prize.

898
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,700
OK?

899
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,110
In other words, and
more specifically,

900
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:08,350
no matter where the
prize is, the player

901
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,380
picks each box with
probability of 1/3.

902
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,735
So the player's making,
effectively, a random choice.

903
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:30,482
All right, and there's one more
assumption we're going to make.

904
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:31,940
Anybody have any
ideas about what's

905
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,786
left to make as an
assumption here?

906
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:35,286
Yeah?

907
00:46:37,724 --> 00:46:39,890
AUDIENCE : I guess, if
Carol's the one who's opening

908
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,290
the boxes, she knows
where all the prizes are.

909
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

910
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:43,740
OK.

911
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,240
So what assumption
should I make?

912
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,077
Yeah, that she picks a box at
random if she has a choice.

913
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,160
All right, so we're going
to make that assumption.

914
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:04,220
So that no matter
where the prize

915
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:19,740
is, if Carol has a
choice, she picks

916
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,614
each box with probability 1/2.

917
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,430
Now, why is this
third one important?

918
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,115
Why might that really matter?

919
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,490
Can anybody think of a reason
why that could be relevant?

920
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:50,182
What if Carol had
some strategy in mind

921
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:52,572
that the contestant knew about?

922
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:54,896
Can you think of why
that might be useful.

923
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:57,794
AUDIENCE : If the contestant
were able to produce

924
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,853
information based off of that,
then there's a higher chance

925
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:03,107
a contestant could figure
out which one to choose.

926
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,073
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

927
00:48:04,073 --> 00:48:09,010
In fact, several years
ago, when I was lecturing,

928
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,770
I said, in fact it
could make a difference.

929
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,220
That there is a way that
Carol can convey information

930
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,930
to the player by of two she's
choosing, which one to pick.

931
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,150
Like, if she has a
choice of 2 or 3,

932
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,790
say she always
picks bigger one, 3.

933
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,920
Well, that might tell
you information about,

934
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,370
she didn't pick 2, so
maybe it has to have,

935
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,460
or she-- well, I don't know.

936
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,970
In fact, that's
wrong, and it doesn't

937
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,239
matter in the case of 2
boxes, this assumption.

938
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:37,030
We're going to make
it, because we're going

939
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,900
to do the analysis with it.

940
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,640
But for three boxes, you can
show that it really doesn't

941
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,650
matter for this assumption.

942
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,820
But if you go to
four boxes, it does.

943
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,510
And so in recitation
tomorrow, you're

944
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,250
going to consider the four
box version of this game.

945
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,810
And if Carol has a strategy
that the player knows about,

946
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:57,480
you could improve the
player's chances of winning.

947
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,730
But not for three, it turns out.

948
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,690
In any case, when you're
setting up a problem,

949
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,940
you've got to set
up your assumptions.

950
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,530
Otherwise, you
don't get anywhere.

951
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,900
These are sort of like
axioms, same kind of thing.

952
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,150
It's fine to make assumptions.

953
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,304
Just state what they are.

954
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:17,470
Now, of course, you also
want them to be reasonable.

955
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,800
All right.

956
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,530
So maybe we're going to
go back now and figure out

957
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,100
how to get the
probabilities of the sample

958
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,690
points, or the outcomes,
for Monty Hall.

959
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,762
Let's go do that.

960
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:38,886
And maybe I'll draw them
in a different color here.

961
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,790
What I'm going to do
is label every edge

962
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:50,990
with a probability associated
with taking that step.

963
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:55,260
So if the prize is placed in
each box with a probability

964
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,400
of 1/3, that says this happens
with probability 1/3, that's

965
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,370
1/3, and that's 1/3.

966
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,570
Same thing here.

967
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,410
Assumption two says
that no matter where

968
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:14,820
the prize is, say it's in box
1, the player chooses each box

969
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,680
with a probably of 1/3.

970
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,110
So given that the
prize is in box 1,

971
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:24,330
the player chooses 1 with
1/3, 2 with 1/3, 3 with 1/3.

972
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,120
Same if the prize is in box 2.

973
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,120
So I label every edge
here with the probability.

974
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,800
All right.

975
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,850
Now I go to this level.

976
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,248
And I'm, at this node, I'm
in the state where prize

977
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:43,960
is in box 1, player
selected box 1,

978
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,420
so Carol has a choice
of 2 or 3 to reveal.

979
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,110
And she's going to reveal
each one with probability 1/2.

980
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,250
So I label 1/2 on each
of these, because that's

981
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,980
what we've assumed.

982
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,370
What probability do I
put on this edge here?

983
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,570
Probability 1, because
there's no choice.

984
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,020
Carol has to do it.

985
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,430
The same here.

986
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:17,520
And I get 1/2, 1/2,
1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1/2.

987
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,670
All right, so I've labeled
every edge with its probability.

988
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,380
Pretty simple, because
it was all assumed.

989
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,196
Now I've got to get a
probability for each outcome.

990
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:28,820
And we do that with
the following rule.

991
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:49,680
The probability
of a sample point

992
00:51:49,680 --> 00:52:08,210
is the product of
the probabilities

993
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,250
on the path leading
to the outcome,

994
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:24,675
the path in the tree leading
to the outcome or the sample

995
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,175
point.

996
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,970
OK.

997
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:38,080
So what this says is just
really, really simple.

998
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,410
The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times

999
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,620
1/2, 1/18.

1000
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:52,470
The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times

1001
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,489
1/2, 1/18.

1002
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:58,030
What's the probability of this
sample point going to be here?

1003
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,130
1/9.

1004
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,200
I've got 1/3 times 1/3 times,
well, this g was 1, is 1/9.

1005
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:16,630
The next one here is 1/3
times 1/3 times 1, 1/9.

1006
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,310
Same thing here.

1007
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,720
1/3 times 1/3 times 1 is 1/9.

1008
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,920
Then I get 1/3 times
1/3 times 1/2 for 1/18.

1009
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,940
And I can keep on going.

1010
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,970
This would be 1/9.

1011
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,400
This one has a 1, so it's a 1/9.

1012
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,116
An 1/18 and 1/18.

1013
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,660
OK.

1014
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,840
Now, that's the rule.

1015
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,900
And you'll always do this.

1016
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,680
You can sort of
see why it works.

1017
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,170
You'll understand
after another week why,

1018
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,740
for sure, why it works.

1019
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,080
But intuitively, you know,
to get to this outcome,

1020
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,170
these are the choices
we had to make.

1021
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,820
First, the box
had to be-- sorry,

1022
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,760
the prize had to be in box 1.

1023
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,220
There's a one-in-three
chance of that happening.

1024
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,190
Now, in those
one-out-of-three chances,

1025
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,250
the chance the player
also picked box 1,

1026
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,990
1/3 of the time of 1/3
of the time that happens.

1027
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,950
All right?

1028
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,360
1/3 of the time, you're here.

1029
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,200
And of that, 1/3 of those
times, you get to here.

1030
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,094
That's 1/3 times 1/3, or 1/9.

1031
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:32,590
And then, 1/2 of those times,
Carol happen to reveal box 2.

1032
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,260
That's 1/18.

1033
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,760
So do you see why
that might make sense,

1034
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,580
why you're multiplying these?

1035
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,400
Because at every step, you
have a chance to diverge.

1036
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,150
And the probability
you take the step

1037
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,850
that we're following
here-- say, in this case,

1038
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,670
it was 1/2-- that cuts down
the chance you land here

1039
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,320
by that probability, 1/2.

1040
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,770
Any questions about that?

1041
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,270
All right.

1042
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,686
For now, you can
take it on faith.

1043
00:55:00,686 --> 00:55:04,159
We'll see why after we
do a few more of these

1044
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,200
over the next week or so.

1045
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,280
Any questions there?

1046
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,100
Is that OK?

1047
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,600
OK.

1048
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,487
Oh, yeah, all right?

1049
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:15,425
AUDIENCE : [INAUDIBLE]

1050
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,880
PROFESSOR: On this one?

1051
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,160
Only one choice.

1052
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,061
So it happens with
probability 1.

1053
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:27,900
Any other questions?

1054
00:55:31,459 --> 00:55:32,860
OK.

1055
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,970
All right.

1056
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,780
So now we can figure out
the probability of winning.

1057
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:42,790
Well, the probability of
winning is we have 1/9, 1/9,

1058
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,801
there's 3 of them,
4 of them, 5, 6.

1059
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,300
All right?

1060
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,131
So the probability of
winning here is 6 times 1/9.

1061
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,730
Because you just sum up the
probabilities of the winning

1062
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,240
sample points.

1063
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,310
There's six of winning.

1064
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,230
They're each 1/9.

1065
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,250
And that's 2/3.

1066
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:26,750
OK?

1067
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,110
So Marilyn was right.

1068
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,660
There's a 2/3 chance of
winning if you switch.

1069
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,900
And now, this is
a formal argument

1070
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,630
that gives you that answer.

1071
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,980
The nice thing is it works
for pretty much every problem

1072
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,880
you ever think about.

1073
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,430
Now, in general,
if you want to know

1074
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,050
the probability
of any event, you

1075
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,540
can follow this same method.

1076
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,180
Let me define what an event is.

1077
00:56:53,085 --> 00:56:58,880
An event is simply a
subset of outcomes,

1078
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,136
a subset of the sample space.

1079
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,530
For example, we could
define the event of losing.

1080
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:20,840
Let's call EL, E sub-L, to be
the event that player loses,

1081
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:26,950
the player loses, with
the switch strategy.

1082
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:35,890
All right?

1083
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,110
Now, to compute the
probability of an event,

1084
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:44,110
we just add the probabilities
of the outcomes in that set.

1085
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,445
So let's get that down.

1086
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:19,577
All right, so formally,
the probability

1087
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:36,805
that an event occurs is simply
the sum, we'll call an event,

1088
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,590
e, let's say, event, e.

1089
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,380
It's a subset of
the sample space.

1090
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,710
The probability that
e occurs is the sum

1091
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:49,920
over the sample points in e of
the probability of those sample

1092
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,650
points.

1093
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:56,280
So for example, the
probability of the event, EL,

1094
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,850
where the player
loses, well, there's

1095
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,129
six sample points
where the player loses,

1096
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:04,420
each with the probability 1/18.

1097
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,040
So it's 1/3 is the probability
the player loses on the switch

1098
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,140
strategy.

1099
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,250
And that's not surprising
because you either win

1100
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:16,880
or you lose.

1101
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,970
The probabilities
have to add to 1.

1102
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,820
So if won with probability 2/3,
you lose with probability 1/3.

1103
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,690
OK?

1104
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,190
All right.

1105
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,860
So Marilyn was right,
much better to switch.

1106
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,810
We'll do a bunch more examples
with Monty Hall tomorrow.

1107
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:39,630
Are there any other questions
on Monty Hall before I change

1108
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:40,590
gears?

1109
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,572
Yeah?

1110
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:44,480
AUDIENCE: So you showed
that when you switch,

1111
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,705
you are more likely
to win than to lose.

1112
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:49,580
But you didn't show that
that's not also true

1113
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,020
when you don't switch.

1114
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,409
PROFESSOR: Ah good question.

1115
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:54,450
What happens if you're
playing the stay strategy.

1116
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,060
Right, maybe you win 2/3
of the time when you stay.

1117
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,190
Maybe.

1118
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,590
Maybe not.

1119
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,090
Right?

1120
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:12,994
Because if I win
when I switch, what

1121
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:14,410
would have happened
if I'd stayed?

1122
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,570
I'd have lost.

1123
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,080
Because if I win
when I switch, it

1124
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,380
means the prize is over there.

1125
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,990
So if I stay, I'm going to lose.

1126
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,680
Which means that if I
do the stay strategy,

1127
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,220
I'm going to lose
2/3 of the time.

1128
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:32,410
So you're right.

1129
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,750
I didn't cover that.

1130
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,420
But we can.

1131
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,160
It's not too hard in this
case because the probability

1132
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,540
of winning on a switch
equals the probability

1133
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,490
of losing on a stick.

1134
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,280
So the probability that
you win with switch

1135
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:58,720
equals the probability you
lose with a stick strategy.

1136
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,080
All right?

1137
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,080
And they're both 2/3,
because they're the same

1138
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,950
and this is 2/3.

1139
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,530
So in fact, what's,
then, the chance

1140
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,780
you win with a stick strategy?

1141
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,952
1/3.

1142
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:17,410
And that's sort of you know,
where Marilyn was coming from.

1143
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,677
Because she said, well,
if you pick the box right

1144
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,260
the first time, which
is what you need

1145
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,870
to get to win with
a stick strategy,

1146
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,810
the chance you pick the
right box is one-in-three.

1147
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,060
And showing, you know, a
goat over here didn't matter.

1148
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,200
It's still one-in-three.

1149
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,330
Now that's gets a--
that's intuition,

1150
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,260
but it can get you
trouble, because say

1151
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,450
you picked this box and Carol
showed you both of these boxes,

1152
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,519
and they had pocket protectors.

1153
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,310
Then what do you know
about the probability

1154
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,750
you won with a stick?

1155
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,710
It's 1.

1156
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,900
Ooh, so things did change there.

1157
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,400
All right?

1158
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,375
So you have to be a little
careful about how you reason,

1159
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,740
OK?

1160
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,300
You've got to do this.

1161
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,630
Stay with that and you'll always
be fine for your strategy.

1162
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:07,160
So really the key is to
resist the temptation

1163
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,224
to just sort of use your
intuition to think about it.

1164
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:12,890
All right.

1165
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,880
Now, this is a pretty
simple example.

1166
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,270
So now I'm going
to do one that's

1167
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:24,200
a little more interesting and a
little more devious in a sense.

1168
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,540
So I need a volunteer.

1169
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,610
We're going to do
a gambling game.

1170
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,700
So I need a volunteer.

1171
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,570
All right.

1172
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,330
Now, he's raised his
hands before I even

1173
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,690
said what the criteria are.

1174
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,065
First, you gotta be confident
you understand probability.

1175
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:41,470
Well, you can fake it.

1176
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,170
But second, and more
importantly, you've

1177
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,200
got to have some money in
your product or you've got

1178
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,560
to borrow some on the way down.

1179
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,185
You got a few bucks there?

1180
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:50,769
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1181
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:52,226
PROFESSOR: All
right, come on down.

1182
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,115
That's really all that
matters, you know.

1183
01:03:03,735 --> 01:03:08,370
OK, now, in this game,
there's three dice.

1184
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,700
Well, that's 'cause
you're smart.

1185
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,610
OK, so let me show you
the dice in this game.

1186
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,935
And these, of course,
are not normal dice.

1187
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:38,570
All right?

1188
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:43,980
So dice A has a 2, a
6, and a 7, and they're

1189
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,390
the same on the reverse side.

1190
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,630
So it's a six-sided
die, and it's fair.

1191
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,990
When you roll it,
the probability A

1192
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,970
comes up 2 is going to be 1/3.

1193
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:52,490
All right?

1194
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,640
Same for 6 and for 7.

1195
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,850
Ah, we're just getting started.

1196
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:07,552
Dice B has a 1, 5, and a 9 and
dice C has a 3, 4, and an 8.

1197
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,260
So I got-- they're
all different numbers,

1198
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,760
the numbers from 1 to 9.

1199
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,190
So just so we're really
clear, the probability

1200
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,100
that A comes up 3 is 1/3.

1201
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:28,394
The same for the probability
A comes up 6 is 1/3 and so on.

1202
01:04:28,394 --> 01:04:30,405
Ah, yes I do mean 2.

1203
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:31,110
Good.

1204
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:31,955
All right, good, you're
paying attention.

1205
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:32,480
That's good.

1206
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,021
There's some hope.

1207
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:35,520
All right?

1208
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,990
Now, here's the game.

1209
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,610
We're each going to pick a die.

1210
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,760
And we're going to roll our die.

1211
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,890
And the higher die wins.

1212
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,140
We're going to roll them once.

1213
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,600
The higher one wins.

1214
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,420
And the loser pays
the winner $1.

1215
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,560
And no tears, OK?

1216
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,250
You got that?

1217
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,750
That's good.

1218
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,916
He's already trying to
figure out which one to pick.

1219
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:57,290
So let's put your
dollar on the table.

1220
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,064
Here we go.

1221
01:04:59,064 --> 01:04:59,980
AUDIENCE: I have a $5.

1222
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,260
Do you have change?

1223
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,460
PROFESSOR: I might have change.

1224
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,150
All right.

1225
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,630
Let's see here.

1226
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,750
Yes, I do have change.

1227
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,150
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
do have a dollar.

1228
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,358
PROFESSOR: You have a dollar.

1229
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:09,962
All right.

1230
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:11,020
Well, for now anyway.

1231
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,707
Let's put the dollar
there on the table.

1232
01:05:14,707 --> 01:05:16,290
AUDIENCE: It's going
to be a $20 next.

1233
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,165
PROFESSOR: We're just
getting warmed up here.

1234
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:20,207
OK, now, there is-- what's
your name, by the way?

1235
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:20,831
AUDIENCE: Will.

1236
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:21,660
PROFESSOR: Will.

1237
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,890
OK, nice to meet you, Will.

1238
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,790
There we go.

1239
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,290
All right.

1240
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,830
Now, there is one problem here.

1241
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:30,595
I don't really have those dice.

1242
01:05:30,595 --> 01:05:32,720
So we're going to have to
do a mathematical version

1243
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,529
of this bet.

1244
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,320
AUDIENCE: You're always
going to win, then.

1245
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,590
PROFESSOR: So what
we're going to do

1246
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,710
is pretend that we did
a roll, head-to-head,

1247
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,770
and whichever one is
more likely to win,

1248
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:47,460
we're going to assume the roll
came out that way, all right?

1249
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,330
Now, I know you've been
studying those three guys there,

1250
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:53,070
those three dice.

1251
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,620
I'm going to be fair and let you
pick first which one you like.

1252
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,910
Now, as you look at
this, you know, you guys

1253
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:04,140
can help him out here if you
can figure out which one's best.

1254
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,540
This has got a couple
good sized numbers.

1255
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,610
You know, two of
these beat these.

1256
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,600
This has the biggest number,
but it also has the smallest.

1257
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,960
This has two small guys in it.

1258
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,427
You now and you want to pick
the one that's likely to--

1259
01:06:17,427 --> 01:06:19,260
AUDIENCE: They all add
up to the same thing.

1260
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,920
PROFESSOR: They do all add up
to the same thing, that's true.

1261
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,420
Yeah.

1262
01:06:25,054 --> 01:06:25,970
Which one do you want?

1263
01:06:38,606 --> 01:06:40,070
Which one do you want here Will?

1264
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:43,654
What's your best one there?

1265
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,418
A does look pretty good.

1266
01:06:49,418 --> 01:06:52,286
You've got two
solid numbers there.

1267
01:06:52,286 --> 01:06:53,242
It does.

1268
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:57,560
A looks like it beats
up on C pretty good.

1269
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,060
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

1270
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,554
I think I'm going
to lose a dollar.

1271
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:02,045
PROFESSOR: That's probably true.

1272
01:07:02,045 --> 01:07:03,533
[LAUGHTER]

1273
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:05,524
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

1274
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:15,509
I don't know.

1275
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:16,591
A looks pretty good to us.

1276
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:17,773
Which one do you like here?

1277
01:07:17,773 --> 01:07:19,192
We'll try them out.

1278
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:21,560
We'll play more games here.

1279
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:29,134
A. All right, Will
likes A. All right.

1280
01:07:29,134 --> 01:07:32,169
And I'm going to
pick-- I'm going

1281
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:34,710
to go with C. I'm going to give
you a fighting chance, right?

1282
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,190
Because we figured A
beat C for sure, right?

1283
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,450
Because you've got a couple
of 6 and 7 beat up 3 and 4

1284
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,050
pretty good.

1285
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:44,597
Yeah, I'm going to
pick C. All right.

1286
01:07:44,597 --> 01:07:46,430
And now we're going to
do-- figure out which

1287
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,050
one's more likely to win.

1288
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,411
And we're going to
make the tree diagram.

1289
01:07:51,411 --> 01:07:51,910
All right?

1290
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:58,265
So here's A. You've got 2,
6, and 7 are your choices.

1291
01:07:58,265 --> 01:07:59,140
And they're each 1/3.

1292
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:05,311
And then, for mine,
I've got 3, 4, and 8.

1293
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,590
3, 4, and 8.

1294
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,130
3, 4, and 8.

1295
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,475
And they're all 1/3 chance.

1296
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:23,430
All right, so I
make my tree here.

1297
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:28,495
I got squished at the
bottom, but they're all 1/3.

1298
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,939
All right, now we're
going to see who wins,

1299
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:34,640
C or A. There's nine outcomes.

1300
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,034
Who wins this outcome?

1301
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:38,740
Oh, I do.

1302
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,584
Yeah, I get all these.

1303
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:41,380
That's good.

1304
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,600
You're in trouble already.

1305
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,957
What happens here, though?

1306
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:44,540
Who wins that?

1307
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:50,010
Your 6 beats 3, 6 beats 4.

1308
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,240
You win those.

1309
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,609
I got you here.

1310
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:56,210
Then you win 7 beats 3.

1311
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,350
A wins.

1312
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,149
7 beats 4, A wins.

1313
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:01,370
It's tied, but, oh,
my 8 beat your 7.

1314
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:04,609
All right.

1315
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:07,939
So let's see here.

1316
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:14,000
There's one, two, three, four,
five for me, each at 1/9.

1317
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,583
All right, so I'm going to win.

1318
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,180
All right?

1319
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,510
Now, in this case, the
sample space is uniform.

1320
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,140
Every probability is the
same for the outcomes.

1321
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,950
They're all 1/9.

1322
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,700
1/3 times 1/3.

1323
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,240
1/3 times 1/3.

1324
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:31,740
All right?

1325
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:36,090
So that's the case where we say
the sample space is uniform.

1326
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:36,960
Don't go anywhere.

1327
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,160
We're going to do
some more here.

1328
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:53,689
The sample space is uniform
if every sample point

1329
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,730
has the same probability.

1330
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,350
In which case, the probability
of the sample points

1331
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,760
would be 1 in the cardinality
of the sample space.

1332
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,320
In this case,
there's nine points.

1333
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,270
They each have probability 1/9.

1334
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:21,190
And in this case, C beats
A with probability of 5/9.

1335
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,070
That means I win the dollar.

1336
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:29,058
All right.

1337
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,274
So do you have some
more money in there?

1338
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,300
In that wallet?

1339
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,170
I'll make change for you.

1340
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:38,220
So, what we're going
to do is play again.

1341
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,910
And you've learned something
now, that C beats A.

1342
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,750
So we play again,
you're probably

1343
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,070
not going to want
to pick A. In fact,

1344
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:49,050
C is surprisingly good there.

1345
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,550
Now, I'll let you
wager more, if you

1346
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,800
want, to win your dollar back.

1347
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,845
Do you want to do
double or nothing?

1348
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:55,745
[LAUGHTER]

1349
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:02,184
AUDIENCE: So you always
get to pick second, though?

1350
01:11:02,184 --> 01:11:02,850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1351
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,092
I've got to be fair here.

1352
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:05,425
I'm going to let you pick first.

1353
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,470
[LAUGHTER]

1354
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,866
All right, you got
a couple bucks?

1355
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,990
We'll do double or nothing.

1356
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:11,656
What do you say?

1357
01:11:11,656 --> 01:11:13,270
I'll make change for you.

1358
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,690
There you go.

1359
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:15,565
Here's $5.

1360
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:17,220
I'll change your $5.

1361
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,270
And then we'll bet $2.

1362
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,390
How's that?

1363
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:23,166
I've actually got
a $2 bill here.

1364
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:23,780
There we go.

1365
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,440
You've got $2.

1366
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,640
There we go.

1367
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,560
All right, double or nothing.

1368
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,924
Will, what do you like?

1369
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,340
You're obviously
not going to pick

1370
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:34,245
A. That just got beat by C.
What do you like, B or C?

1371
01:11:42,724 --> 01:11:44,801
Well, one of them's
got to be best.

1372
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,217
One of them's got
to be best here.

1373
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:48,712
You've just got to figure
out which one it is.

1374
01:11:48,712 --> 01:11:51,970
AUDIENCE: I feel like everyone's
going to have [INAUDIBLE].

1375
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,500
If I choose C, let me see.

1376
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,610
That would be
[INAUDIBLE] so I guess.

1377
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,604
PROFESSOR: I won't pick
A, that's for sure.

1378
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:02,354
AUDIENCE: If you pick
B, I get one from 4,

1379
01:12:02,354 --> 01:12:03,854
I get two from the
8, which is four.

1380
01:12:03,854 --> 01:12:05,318
And you get the other five.

1381
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:09,270
If I pick C and you pick A,
that means I get one from the 3,

1382
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,246
I get one from the 4.

1383
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:14,704
If I get two from the
8, you still get 5.

1384
01:12:14,704 --> 01:12:16,186
PROFESSOR: That's good.

1385
01:12:16,186 --> 01:12:19,644
You've figured out
you're screwed here.

1386
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:20,650
That's very good.

1387
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,980
All right.

1388
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,120
So, yeah, so he's sort
of-- he's doing great.

1389
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,245
He's figured out, because
he went through this sort

1390
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:28,800
of like this method, what all
the possible outcomes were.

1391
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,680
And he's discovered that,
no matter what he picks,

1392
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,830
I'm going to beat him.

1393
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,340
So let's see why
that's the case.

1394
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,440
So let's see.

1395
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,130
So because you figured it
out, I won't take your money

1396
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:39,990
this time.

1397
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,770
But we'll do some
more in a minute.

1398
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:46,900
So say Will picked--
say he picked C.

1399
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:52,000
And say that then I
will pick B. All right,

1400
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,220
so on C, there's three choices.

1401
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:55,830
3.

1402
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,480
4, and 8.

1403
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,775
And then, on my choice of
B, there's 1, 5, and 9.

1404
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,120
All right, so I get 1, 5, and 9.

1405
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,070
And now we can
see who wins here.

1406
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:17,810
Well, C wins there,
loses here, loses there.

1407
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:22,370
C wins here, and B
wins the next two.

1408
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,000
And C wins these.

1409
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,650
And B wins the tiebreaker.

1410
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:30,280
So B beats C with
probability 5/9.

1411
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:38,920
All right.

1412
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,650
So you don't want to pick
A, you don't want to pick C,

1413
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,094
you want to try a bet with B?

1414
01:13:48,363 --> 01:13:52,840
I mean, look, you've got B
beats C. We just showed that.

1415
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,847
C beats A. I mean, that's a
sure bet if I ever saw one.

1416
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,284
[LAUGHTER]

1417
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:01,200
PROFESSOR: What do you think?

1418
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,268
AUDIENCE: So if I pick B and you
pick C, that means [INAUDIBLE]

1419
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,172
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

1420
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:22,012
But if he picks A, then
I get [INAUDIBLE] Yeah,

1421
01:14:22,012 --> 01:14:24,010
I'd still get 4, so--

1422
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,752
PROFESSOR: So if you pick
B, what am I going to do?

1423
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:28,499
AUDIENCE: Oh, you're
going to pick A.

1424
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:31,040
PROFESSOR: I'm going to pick A.
Let's see how that works out.

1425
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,850
All right, so B has 1, 5, and 9.

1426
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,685
A is, yeah, 2, 6, and 7.

1427
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:50,670
OK, so you're going to
lose all three there.

1428
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:53,320
A wins those.

1429
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,950
A wins-- no, you win.

1430
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,967
B wins there, but A
wins the next couple.

1431
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:02,341
And then, you win
the last three.

1432
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:13,090
So A wins, again,
5/9 of the time.

1433
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,880
So how is this possible?

1434
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:26,040
We've got A beats B,
beats C, beats A. All 5/9.

1435
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,885
How is that possible?

1436
01:15:27,885 --> 01:15:29,250
Did we make a mistake?

1437
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,610
Well, why isn't it possible?

1438
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:40,050
Whoever said probabilities
were transitive?

1439
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:40,912
Right?

1440
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,370
I mean, you'd sort
of think there's

1441
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,260
a best of the three die.

1442
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,220
But for any one that
you pick, that he picks,

1443
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,428
I can find one that's better.

1444
01:15:47,428 --> 01:15:49,630
And it goes in a cycle.

1445
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,130
All right?

1446
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,820
So you'd think picking
first, you've got a shot

1447
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,780
to pick the best one.

1448
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,890
But picking second
always wins this game,

1449
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,411
if you pick the right one.

1450
01:15:59,411 --> 01:15:59,910
All right.

1451
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,280
You know, since you did
good and figured that out,

1452
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,850
I'm going to give you a
special opportunity here.

1453
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:06,350
All right?

1454
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:11,540
Now, I'm going to
let you go second.

1455
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,030
All right?

1456
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,740
So I'm going to
pick one, and I'm

1457
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,360
going to let you pick after me.

1458
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,480
And then we're going to bet.

1459
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,812
There's going to be
a little twist to it.

1460
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,270
But you want to
pick second, right?

1461
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:30,485
All right, well, let me tell
you what I'm going to do.

1462
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,030
Just to make it-- I want
to do a different analysis.

1463
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,155
We already did these three,
so what I'm going to do

1464
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:37,289
is an analysis where
we roll them twice.

1465
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:38,830
Otherwise, it's the
same basic thing,

1466
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,510
but I want to do an analysis
with more outcomes here.

1467
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,310
We've sort of beat
this one to death.

1468
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,210
So I'm going to go first.

1469
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:52,860
And let's see, what
do I want to pick?

1470
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,520
Hm.

1471
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,720
Well, what should I pick,
if I'm going to do this?

1472
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,330
I guess I'll pick B, all right?

1473
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,190
So I'm going to pick B here.

1474
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:07,440
All right.

1475
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:07,970
How much do you
want to bet here?

1476
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,678
I'm going to let you
win your money back.

1477
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:11,630
I'll let you bet up to $10.

1478
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,245
Your choice.

1479
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:16,970
What do you-- what do
you want to bet here?

1480
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,280
We've got to put some
money on the table,

1481
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,488
make it a little interesting.

1482
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,314
Yeah, you pick--

1483
01:17:23,314 --> 01:17:25,230
AUDIENCE: Do you roll a
different die or what?

1484
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:26,438
PROFESSOR: No, the same ones.

1485
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,680
The die don't change.

1486
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,220
I'm picking B. And I'm going
to roll it a couple times.

1487
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,700
And I'm going to
add up my score.

1488
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,700
And then, you get to pick
whatever die you want.

1489
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,783
I'm going to let you pick.

1490
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:39,770
I mean, I'm going to let you
pick the one that beats it.

1491
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,620
You roll yours a couple times.

1492
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,310
And now we see which
one has the higher

1493
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,393
sum, who's more likely to win.

1494
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:47,726
AUDIENCE: So it's the sum
total, like you roll a 9 and 9

1495
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:48,777
and I roll a 7 and 7.

1496
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:51,110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then I'm
going to win, because I get 18

1497
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,090
and you got 14.

1498
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,270
If I roll a 9 and
a 1, I get a 10.

1499
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,884
You roll a 6 and a
7, you beat me at 13.

1500
01:17:56,884 --> 01:17:58,360
All right?

1501
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:02,490
So which one do
you want to pick?

1502
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:05,740
You could pick C. But you've got
to put the money on the table

1503
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:08,739
here, whatever you want to bet.

1504
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:11,280
You know, I want to give you a
chance to win your money back.

1505
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:18,032
What's the probability
he's going to lose?

1506
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:19,514
[LAUGHTER]

1507
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:20,449
You got a T-Card?

1508
01:18:20,449 --> 01:18:21,490
What've you got in there?

1509
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,512
Ah, I'll take the
[INAUDIBLE] card.

1510
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:24,985
What's that worth?

1511
01:18:24,985 --> 01:18:27,931
Ah, it's worth a few bucks here.

1512
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:33,390
All right, so I'm picking
B. Which are you picking?

1513
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:40,304
I've really got his
head messed up now.

1514
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:41,720
AUDIENCE: There's
$4 on the table.

1515
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,690
Take that and run.

1516
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:44,690
PROFESSOR: Yeah, really.

1517
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,570
We already saw-- I'll
give you a hint here.

1518
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:50,860
A beats B. 5/9 of the time,
A comes up higher than B.

1519
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:54,030
So if we roll them
twice, your odds

1520
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:59,420
got even better that
A beats B. All right,

1521
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,850
so Will goes with A. Will,
that was a big mistake.

1522
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,020
All right.

1523
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,020
How can it be a mistake?

1524
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,220
A beats B 5/9 of the time.

1525
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,220
Now what we're going to do
is make the decision tree.

1526
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:15,351
If we roll B twice,
if we roll A twice.

1527
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:15,850
All right.

1528
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,530
Let's see what happens.

1529
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:19,090
This is a nasty
one to write down.

1530
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,840
In fact, you'll start
seeing this when you

1531
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,100
do these tree method things.

1532
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,725
Sometimes the trees
get a little hairy,

1533
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:27,520
so we've got to sort of
approximate it a little bit.

1534
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,140
So here's B, right?

1535
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,950
I got 1, 5, and 9
for my first roll.

1536
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,430
And then I got 1, 5, and
9 for my second roll.

1537
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,590
And I add these up.

1538
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:47,990
See, if you read the notes
ahead, sometimes that helps.

1539
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,495
6-- here are my outcomes.

1540
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:51,120
These are the numbers
I'm going to get.

1541
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,000
These are my nine values.

1542
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,360
Your nine values,
you got 2, 6, and 7.

1543
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,170
Then each 2, 6, and 7 again.

1544
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:15,165
So we add those up, you got 4,
8, 9, 8, 12, 13, 9, 13, and 14.

1545
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:17,290
And now, we have
each one of these

1546
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:19,130
against each one of these.

1547
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,830
Because there's 81 outcomes.

1548
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:22,230
I got four levels to the tree.

1549
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,370
And rather than draw four
levels of this [INAUDIBLE] tree

1550
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,250
to get 81 outcomes,
you're going to say

1551
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:30,280
that each one of
these corresponds

1552
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:34,330
to this tree, all right,
that has nine leaves.

1553
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:40,205
And now we can just count
up how many times I win.

1554
01:20:40,205 --> 01:20:41,630
Well, 2 got nothing.

1555
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:44,270
That's a 0.

1556
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,120
Let's see how many times 6 wins.

1557
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,064
One-- one time.

1558
01:20:50,064 --> 01:20:53,210
10-- one, two,
three, four, five.

1559
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:57,050
All right, we've got that.

1560
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:01,260
6 wins, we already
decided, once.

1561
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:06,630
10, we decided already,
wins five times.

1562
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,612
14 wins one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

1563
01:21:09,612 --> 01:21:12,290
eight, and ties once.

1564
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:15,390
Tie-- one.

1565
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,550
10, we already got was five.

1566
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:23,260
14, we already got,
was eight and a tie.

1567
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:28,000
And finally, I get
18 wins every time.

1568
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,780
Let's add this up.

1569
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:36,210
I got 17, 22, 30,
35, 36, 41, 42 times

1570
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:42,370
plus half the ties out of 81.

1571
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,120
How much money's on
this [INAUDIBLE] card?

1572
01:21:49,224 --> 01:21:50,440
Ah, smart guy.

1573
01:21:53,919 --> 01:21:55,410
How did this happen?

1574
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,550
A is more likely to
beat B, higher than B.

1575
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,160
But you roll them
twice, and it's

1576
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,770
less likely to be
as large on the sum?

1577
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:05,020
Well, why not?

1578
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,760
It's just our intuition's
all screwed up.

1579
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,160
But the math is straightforward.

1580
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,410
In fact, an amazing
thing happens.

1581
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:17,710
If you roll them twice,
they reverse completely.

1582
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:22,590
A is worse than B, is worse
than C, is worse than A

1583
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,150
if you roll them twice.

1584
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:27,570
If you roll them three times,
something else happens.

1585
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,540
In fact, it was known
for a long time,

1586
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,665
this phenomenon
happens with one roll.

1587
01:22:31,665 --> 01:22:34,070
And when I was making lecture
notes a few years ago,

1588
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,869
I noticed they reverse
with two rolls.

1589
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,660
And then we did a class
project to discover

1590
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,830
what happens with k rolls.

1591
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:44,034
And it turns out that you can
get every possible combination.

1592
01:22:44,034 --> 01:22:45,450
You know, on some
number of rolls,

1593
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:50,230
A beats both B and C and B
beats C. Other number of rolls,

1594
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:53,010
A beats them both and C beats B.

1595
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,600
And then, motivated by
that, some researchers

1596
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,330
out in San Diego showed
that there's arbitrarily

1597
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:03,600
strange dice, now, not
with just three sides,

1598
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,830
but with more sides.

1599
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:09,025
Such that, for any tournaments--
remember a tournament

1600
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,410
from graph theory,
where everybody beats,

1601
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,580
you know, between a pair of
players, one player wins.

1602
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:18,130
You can make the relation
for any tournament

1603
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:20,110
show up for a
particular set of dice

1604
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,489
by rolling a certain
number of times.

1605
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:24,280
All right, which is
just really fascinating

1606
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,280
that you can prove that.

1607
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,660
So these dice can
get arbitrarily weird

1608
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:30,900
in terms of which die is
likely to come up and be

1609
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,989
better than another die.

1610
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:34,280
All right, that's it for today.

1611
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,430
Let me give you your
money back here.

1612
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:37,055
And I've got a gift
certificate you can

1613
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:40,170
have for being a good sport.

1614
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:40,670
Here you go.

1615
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,160
How much money did I take here?

1616
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,697
AUDIENCE: I think only like $2.

1617
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:44,280
PROFESSOR: $2?

1618
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,620
All right, there you go.

1619
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,270
Very good.

1620
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:46,770
Thanks.

1621
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,140
So we'll do a lot more examples
over the next week or two.
