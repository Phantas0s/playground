8
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:24,290
PROFESSOR: Now
generally speaking,

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,226
a proof is going to have
seven characteristics

10
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,650
that you want to keep in mind.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:41,470
Good proofs are correct--
that's obviously important--

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,930
complete-- you've got to
have all the details there.

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,680
All of the key steps
have to be there.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,580
They should be clear so we can
understand what's going on.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,300
Brief is good.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,630
You don't want to crush
somebody with all the details.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,570
You want to get to the
key points, and be crisp.

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,330
It's really nice
if they're elegant.

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,320
Now, that means clever.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,397
It's the mathematician's
notion of beauty.

21
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:21,730
Like you go to the art museum,
and the artists will say,

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,210
wow, that's a
beautiful painting.

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,160
In mathematics, you say,
wow, that's an elegant proof.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,410
It's crisp, clever,
short, to the point.

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,040
And it's really the
highest compliment

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,770
you can get from a
mathematician, anyway.

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,882
And there's a lot of
judgment that goes into that.

28
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:42,340
Just like in art--
there's judgment

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,382
over what is great art.

30
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:45,840
The proof should
be well organized.

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,950
For example, use
lemmas the same way

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,500
you would use
subroutines in writing

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,400
code-- helps to make it clear.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,105
And the proof
should be in order.

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,030
Sometimes you'll see
proofs where things are

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,950
done in a haphazard fashion.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,810
All the pieces are there, but
they're in the wrong order.

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,120
Sometimes-- and they teach
this in some high schools--

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,790
they teach you to
do proofs backwards.

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,850
And the classic thing
there is, say you're

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,600
trying to prove a equals b.

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,530
Well, the proof sometimes
will start with what

43
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,080
you're trying to prove.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,200
And then they'll do
a bunch of steps.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,270
And then you'll end
up with 1 equals 1,

46
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,900
and you'll write a
check, because you went

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,440
from a equals b to 1 equals 1.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,510
And that's, of course, true.

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,250
Now, that's not a
good thing to do.

50
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,400
It can be correct if the
implications go this way.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,520
Because really, you're starting
with a fact-- 1 equals 1--

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,160
and deriving a equals b.

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,000
So if, in fact, the
implications work this way,

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,720
then your proof is right.

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,930
But most people, especially
as you get farther along,

56
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,470
think about it going
from top to bottom.

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,330
So don't use this technique,
because it'll confuse people.

58
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,940
You're liable to make a mistake.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,790
Just start with 1 equals 1
and work your way from there--

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,210
top down for being in order.

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,090
Now, good proofs are
very much like good code.

62
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,750
In fact, one of the reasons we
care so much about teaching you

63
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,990
how to write a good
proof in computer science

64
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,180
is so that later on,
you'll be able to prove

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,550
that your programs are doing
what you expect-- what they're

66
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,680
supposed to do.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,325
Now, there are many famous
examples where programs did not

68
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:40,700
do what they were
supposed to do,

69
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,340
with disastrous consequences.

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,800
The Airbus A300 was one of the
first commercial jets totally

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
operated by software.

72
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,140
It could take off, fly, and
land totally by software.

73
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,600
It was a major advance
in the airline industry.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,110
The only problem
was, that on one

75
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,140
of the first
flights of the A300,

76
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,240
the software accidentally
opened the rear door just

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,580
before landing.

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,940
And the plane
crashed as a result.

79
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,740
It was the first plane crash
in commercial history because

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,130
of a software bug.

81
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,589
There's a famous radiation
device for cancer patients

82
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,970
called the Therac-25.

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,350
It's famous because it
got into a race condition

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,070
occasionally, which
caused the device

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,310
to just slam the patient
with radiation-- so much so,

86
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,700
it killed the patient.

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,960
And they had multiple examples
of this, and of course,

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,490
a lot of lawsuits afterwards.

89
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,764
How many of you all
remember the 2000 election?

90
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:40,430
A few of you do.

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,320
OK, this will probably be the
last class that remembers that.

92
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,030
But that's where Al Gore was
going up against George Bush--

93
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,930
very close election-- all
came down to recounting

94
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,060
the votes in Florida.

95
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,370
But in fact, Al Gore got
negative 16,000 votes

96
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,590
in one county because
of a software bug

97
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,150
in the electronic
voting booths, which

98
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,501
I think they got rid of a
lot of them in the election

99
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,000
after that.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,010
Because the software was buggy.

101
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,840
So poor Al had enough
problem which chads

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,090
and funny business in Florida.

103
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,580
But getting negative
16,000 votes certainly

104
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,890
didn't help his chances.

105
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,820
Several years ago, a
single faulty command

106
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,320
in a computer system used by
United and American Airlines

107
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,800
grounded the entire fleets
to both airlines for close

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,210
to a day.

109
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,050
Because they
couldn't do anything.

110
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,480
They're all run by computer, and
the whole thing was screwed up.

111
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
So there's lots more examples.

112
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,790
We run into this issue
all the time at Akamai.

113
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,760
Akamai is a company started
by MIT folks-- by myself,

114
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,850
and Danny Lewin, and a dozen
undergrads in the late 1990s.

115
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,720
And we deliver a
lot of the content

116
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,850
you get on the web-- Facebook,
all the search engines.

117
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,790
A lot of the stuff you go
to comes from our servers.

118
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,710
So we've got to be
very careful that we

119
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,039
don't have software bugs.

120
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:58,830
Now, in fact we do.

121
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,710
And we catch them
every once in awhile.

122
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,594
But if we got a bad
one, it would bring down

123
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:03,760
all the sites you go to you.

124
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,855
You wouldn't be able to
go to those sites anymore.

125
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:06,980
And everybody would notice.

126
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,355
It would be sort
of embarrassing.

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,680
Now, this really does matter.

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,380
And this is going to sound a
little scary, but someday--

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,620
probably 30, 20 years
from now, somewhere

130
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,080
in there-- it's possible
that all of us, our lives

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,490
may depend on the software
that some of you write.

132
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,010
In fact, to bring this
home how scary it is,

133
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,550
look at the person
sitting next to you.

134
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,750
And imagine that in 25
years, your life depends on

135
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,280
whether their code
does what it's

136
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,820
supposed to do-- little scary.

137
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,340
That's why we are
very motivated to help

138
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,660
you learn how to make
rock-solid arguments,

139
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,290
so you don't have code that
fries one of your classmates

140
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,040
someday, or puts him in
a bad plane situation.

141
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,100
Now unfortunately,
writing rock-solid proofs

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,910
is a very hard thing to do.

143
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,380
Even the world's
best mathematicians

144
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,550
mess them up on a regular basis.

145
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,570
In fact, it's estimated that one
third of all published proofs

146
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,330
have bugs, have flaws, that
render the proof incorrect.

147
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,040
The trouble often arises
because we get lazy.

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,570
We don't write down all the
details or all the steps.

149
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,880
Because, wow, it's clear.

150
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,740
Let's just move on.

151
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,330
Now, this can be OK.

152
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,010
Not such a good practice,
but it dramatically

153
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,100
increases the chances
of making a mistake.

154
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,650
And there's some
very famous examples

155
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,274
in the math literature
from the world's

156
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:50,320
most famous mathematicians.

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,837
Gauss-- and we'll
talk about Gauss

158
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,670
later during the term--
he's one of the most

159
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,420
famous mathematicians ever.

160
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,640
He wrote his PhD thesis in 1799.

161
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,440
And it's usually referred to
as the first rigorous proof

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,350
of the fundamental
theorem of algebra.

163
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,130
And that says that
every polynomial

164
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,410
has a 0 over the complex
numbers-- something

165
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,325
probably a lot of you
learned in high school.

166
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,200
You get a polynomial.

167
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
You can find roots
of the polynomial

168
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,100
over the complex numbers.

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,580
But his thesis contains
the following quote,

170
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,730
"If a branch of an algebraic
curve enters a bounded region,

171
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,870
it must necessarily leave again.

172
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,480
Nobody, to my knowledge,
has ever doubted this fact."

173
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,679
Warning signs-- buzzers-- should
be going off in your brain.

174
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,090
"But if anybody desires it,
then on another occasion,

175
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,100
I intend to give a demonstration
which will leave no doubt."

176
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,620
So he's using something
that he believes to be true.

177
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,420
He sort of thinks it's clear,
that everybody knows it.

178
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,530
But he writes this down.

179
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,946
And when you're
writing that down,

180
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,730
you know there's a problem.

181
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,700
And in fact, there's
another Fields medalist--

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,800
we talked about Fields medals
last week-- Stephen Smale

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,650
writes that this was an immense
gap in the proof that was not

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,500
filled until 1920-- more
than 100 years later.

185
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,310
So Gauss never could
give the proof,

186
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,870
and nobody did for
over a century more.

187
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,830
Remember the Poincare
conjecture from last week?

188
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,210
We had Colbert
talking about that.

189
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,440
In 1900, Poincare claimed
it was a simple fact.

190
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,790
Four years later, he
decided it wasn't so simple,

191
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,600
and he demoted his claim to
the status of a conjecture.

192
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,240
And of course, this became the
famous Poincare conjecture,

193
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,480
which took another
century to solve.

194
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,380
So when you think you
see yourself doing this,

195
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,714
famous mathematicians do it
too, and it catches them.

196
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,130
So you want to not
try to do that.

197
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,260
Now, in fact, just to
really bring home the point,

198
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,940
we've made a top 10
list of proof techniques

199
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,330
you should not use in 6.042.

200
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,624
So everybody go to
the handout here.

201
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,540
In fact, there's lot of
them on the back, too,

202
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,730
but on the front page,
there's the top 10.

203
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,220
So we're going to
go through these.

204
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,910
These are the ones
we've most observed

205
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,020
in 6.042 over the years.

206
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,270
Number 10-- proof by
throwing in the kitchen sink.

207
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,930
The author writes down every
theorem known to mankind,

208
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,445
and then adds a few
more for good measure.

209
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,820
Now, this is good, because
when you're questioned later--

210
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,780
you're trying to get a
better score on your exam--

211
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,810
you say, look, the proof
contains all the key facts.

212
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,010
They're all here.

213
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,030
And so that does help.

214
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,030
You get extra credit if
all the facts are there.

215
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,267
We are literally seen students
copy over their crib sheet,

216
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,350
if they got enough time,
for a problem they're not

217
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,250
knowing how to solve, just to
get all of the facts in there.

218
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,590
Number nine-- proof by example--
the author gives the case n

219
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,290
equals 2 and
suggests it contains

220
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,166
most of the ideas of
the general proof.

221
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,540
In fact, a student
before a class

222
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,690
was telling me on one of
the homework problems,

223
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,410
he talked about it to
his non-math friends,

224
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,220
and they gave examples,
not the proof.

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,210
Number eight-- proof by
vigorous hand-waving-- one

226
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,440
of my favorites-- I get
up here and wave my hands.

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,575
And it must be true.

228
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,890
Number seven-- proof by
cumbersome notation--

229
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,080
here the reader gets
hopelessly confused,

230
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,060
gives up, and says OK.

231
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,130
In fact, I once
had a grad student,

232
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,740
and we called him the
encryptor, because he

233
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,900
could take the simplest proof
and so encrypt it in notation

234
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,170
and God knows what, you could
never understand the proof

235
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,990
and figure out if it was
really right or wrong.

236
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,520
That goes well with number
six-- proof by exhaustion--

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,850
so does throwing in
the kitchen sink.

238
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,870
Number five--
proof by omission--

239
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,680
you will see that a lot,
also by faculty-- "The reader

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,300
may easily supply the details.

241
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,150
The other cases are
analogous-- trivial."

242
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,400
Experts use that all the time.

243
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,340
You can find a lot
of my papers online.

244
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,840
"The proof is
trivial"-- very bad.

245
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,920
Every once in a while, it
turned out not to be so trivial.

246
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,170
Number four-- proof by
picture-- we've seen those,

247
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,000
saw one on Tuesday.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,230
Number three-- proof by
vehement assertion-- sort

249
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,800
of like the hand-waving.

250
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,780
The more forceful you
are in your argument,

251
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,400
the higher you raise your
voice, the more intimidating

252
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,160
you become, doesn't
make it more true.

253
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,350
Number two-- proof by appeal
to intuition-- you say,

254
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,230
"any moron knows that."

255
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,480
Well, you're sort of
reluctant to now question it.

256
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,430
And then number one-- proof by
reference to eminent authority.

257
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,480
I saw Fermat on the elevator
and he said he had a proof.

258
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,330
I don't think so.

259
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,420
Fermat's been dead
for over 300 years.

260
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,840
And he was not so reliable
in the first place.

261
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,940
In fact, he has one of
the most famous assertions

262
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,860
that turned into a conjecture,
called Fermat's last theorem.

263
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,425
And it was not really a
theorem by the time he died.

264
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,860
How many people have heard
of Fermat's last theorem?

265
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,010
Raise your hand.

266
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,920
Yeah, pretty famous.

267
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,935
It's the one theorem he proved
that actually, he didn't prove.

268
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,850
It says, for all
n bigger than 2,

269
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:08,220
there does not exist an x, y,
and z in the natural numbers

270
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,040
plus the positive natural
numbers such that x to the n

271
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,540
plus y to the n
equals z to the n.

272
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,370
Now of course, for
n equals 2, that's

273
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,580
just the Pythagorean theorem.

274
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,180
You can find three,
four, and five, when

275
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,860
you square them satisfy that.

276
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,970
But it says this does not
work for any higher value,

277
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,360
any higher power, than 2.

278
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,030
Now in 1637, Fermat wrote
in the margin of a block

279
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,410
that he had discovered
a proof of this result,

280
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,510
but the proof was too
long to fit in the margin.

281
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,870
And so he wasn't going to
supply the details there.

282
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,730
And he never did
supply the details.

283
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,750
And it took 350 years and
100s and 100s of pages.

284
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,860
A fellow named Andrew
Wiles-- took him personally

285
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,710
over 10 years.

286
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,620
He more or less locked
himself in his room

287
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,360
for 10 years, produced
100s of pages,

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,350
and he finally did prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

289
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,520
So Fermat was right
about one thing--

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,224
it would not fit in the margin.

291
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,640
At least, there's
no proof that we

292
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,990
know of that would fit
in the margin of a book.

293
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,480
Any questions on
proof technique?

294
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,840
We're going to pound a lot on
this over the next few weeks.

295
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,650
All right, next
we're going to look

296
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,850
at a class of puzzles that was
very popular in the late 1800s.

297
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,390
Now, in these puzzles, you have
a grid of letters or numbers.

298
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,130
And you've got to slide the
letters and numbers around

299
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,750
to put them in order.

300
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,440
And so as an example, here's
the problem on a three

301
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,050
by three grid, or
an eight puzzle.

302
00:14:50,050 --> 00:15:00,570
You want to find a
sequence of moves

303
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:07,160
to go from this configuration.

304
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,370
I'll do a three by three case.

305
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,060
I have a here, b
here, c, d, e, f.

306
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,530
And I've put g and
h out of order.

307
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,820
And that square is blank, and
I can move tiles or letters

308
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,600
into it.

309
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,670
I'm going to start here.

310
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,170
And I eventually want to
get to the configuration

311
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,620
where the letters are all
in alphabetical order.

312
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,270
So g and h are in order.

313
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,430
Now, a legal move means
you slide a letter

314
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,910
into an adjacent blank square.

315
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,100
And you can go in
a row or a column.

316
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,870
OK, everybody
understand the game,

317
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,680
what you're supposed to do?

318
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,810
You slide these things.

319
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,680
That could go down.

320
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,600
That could go across.

321
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,450
How many people played
a game like this before?

322
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,040
Good, a lot of you.

323
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,270
OK, so I need some
volunteers who

324
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,120
are good at solving
puzzles that can do this,

325
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,500
have played games like this,
that are pretty quick at it.

326
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:35,280
So I've got it here.

327
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,166
Who would like to come down?

328
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,790
There are prizes if
you can solve this.

329
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,655
What we're going to
do is solve this.

330
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,530
And see if you can solve
it in three minutes.

331
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,170
But I need three students
to come on down and do this.

332
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,360
Who'd like to volunteer?

333
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,665
Who thinks they can handle
puzzles under pressure?

334
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,470
So you have the g
and h out of order.

335
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,695
So it's not so hard.

336
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,960
You move the f down there.

337
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,977
I don't know, play
around like that.

338
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,060
So I need some volunteers.

339
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,210
Who'd like to come
down and do this?

340
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,089
You can win candy.

341
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,589
I've got candy here.

342
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,609
There's even a prize if you
don't make it in three minutes.

343
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,109
Who wants some candy?

344
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,610
Nobody?

345
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,150
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

346
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,940
What's that?

347
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,170
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

348
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,670
There is.

349
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,750
Come on down.

350
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,250
All right, now, who's
going to help him out?

351
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,490
I need a couple more people
here just to mess him up,

352
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,434
because by himself--
there we go-- good.

353
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:32,850
Anybody else like
to come on down?

354
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,266
Because if we get
three, it really

355
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:37,070
gets hard, because you fight
over what moves to make.

356
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,370
Now, what I'd like you
all to do is sort of

357
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,746
scream out
possibilities for him.

358
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,620
Like he figures it out
there, you scream out,

359
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,000
that'll really screw him up.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,339
OK, now, you can't pick them up.

361
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,880
You've just got to
slide them around.

362
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,324
And you can go, and
we'll go to 2:56,

363
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:51,490
and see if you can solve it.

364
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,470
If you can solve it,
you guys get candy.

365
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,723
And if you can figure it out
out there, let them know.

366
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,190
Slide to the gray area.

367
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,780
No, you can't use the gray area.

368
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:08,270
All right, you've got
about two minutes.

369
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,477
They have the g and h in order.

370
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,560
Everything else is pretty
well screwed up, though.

371
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,760
What do you got?

372
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,900
A, b, c, d, e, f, h g-- no, no,
no, that's where you started,

373
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,400
guys.

374
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,750
That's not it.

375
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,790
It was close, just one
was out of order is all.

376
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,850
Just one letter at a time.

377
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,430
There you go.

378
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:44,060
I think they need help.

379
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,710
We got about a minute ago.

380
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,892
Cannot see anything.

381
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,850
You can't see anything.

382
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,350
Well, I don't know
if it would help.

383
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,330
You want to show
them where you are?

384
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,570
This is not looking good.

385
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,655
We're pretty close to
the end here, guys.

386
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:23,020
A, b, c, f, e, d,
g, h-- g, h is good.

387
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,070
F is not so good.

388
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,965
All right, you got
about 30 seconds.

389
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,530
Whoa, what are you guys doing?

390
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,740
One at a time here.

391
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,566
One at the time.

392
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:53,520
In fact, I think
time is up here.

393
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,640
All right, 2:56.

394
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,020
Oh, no, no.

395
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,110
That we don't do.

396
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,020
No diagonal moves--
no, no, no, no.

397
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,680
All right, well, you
guys were good sports,

398
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,950
so you do get a prize.

399
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,200
It's not the candy, but I have
these wonderful plastic Nerd

400
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,139
Pride pocket protectors for you.

401
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,430
There you go, very good sports.

402
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,570
Thank you, well done.

403
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,400
All right.

404
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,700
[APPLAUSE]

405
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,780
Now, I was a little
cruel to these guys,

406
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,780
for a lot of reasons.

407
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,830
It's impossible?

408
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,162
You think?

409
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,930
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

410
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,590
Yeah it is impossible.

411
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,610
This is impossible to do.

412
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,470
Let's see if we can
prove it's impossible.

413
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,230
Because it doesn't seem
so hard, necessarily.

414
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,940
But let's take
that as a theorem.

415
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:16,990
There is no sequence
of legal moves--

416
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:26,680
diagonal moves makes this a
lot easier-- to invert g and h

417
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:37,530
and also return all the other
letters to their original order

418
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,106
or position.

419
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,790
Now, to prove this,
we're going to use

420
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,530
what's called an invariant.

421
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,910
It's a very powerful
and commonly used

422
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,470
concept in computer science,
very closely tied to induction,

423
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,500
as we'll see.

424
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,800
In order to show that
your system can never

425
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,580
reach a particular
special state,

426
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,900
it is sufficient to show
there's some property called

427
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,880
the invariant that holds
at the initial state,

428
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,540
and that is preserved
by every legal move,

429
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,770
and is not present-- does not
hold-- in that special state.

430
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,230
The idea is, if you get
this magic property called

431
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,540
the invariant and it
holds at the start,

432
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,150
and it holds across
every step, then

433
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,640
the only states
you can reach have

434
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,450
to have to have the
property, be invariant.

435
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,850
And if the special state
doesn't have that property,

436
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,060
you can't reach it.

437
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,970
All right, so there
is going to be

438
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,130
some property we're going
to look for that held

439
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,110
at the beginning here-- and
the beginning had this set

440
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,420
up-- that holds, is
preserved, by every move,

441
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,800
every legal move, but does
not hold in this state.

442
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,527
And therefore, you can never
reach this state legally.

443
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:07,360
So they were doomed.

444
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,710
So we've got to figure
out what that property is.

445
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,730
And that's always the
trick in analyzing

446
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,790
systems or
algorithms-- is what's

447
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,930
that key property, the
invariant property?

448
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,680
So to figure out the
invariant, we sort of

449
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,700
have to look at what
happens during a move

450
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,080
in this system-- a transition.

451
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,130
Well, there's two
kinds of moves.

452
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,080
There's a row move.

453
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:45,590
And an example of a
row move is you might

454
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:53,560
have a, b, c, d, g, e, f, h.

455
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,810
And I'm going to move the g
its row to the blank square.

456
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,812
So it would become this state.

457
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,720
So g moves rightward
into the blank,

458
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,020
and the rest stays the same.

459
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,150
Now, when I make a row
move, did the relative order

460
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,135
of the items change?

461
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,624
No.

462
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,040
Of course, to be
precise, I better

463
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,280
define what relative order
means, or the natural order.

464
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:39,210
So by the natural order, I mean
this ordering-- 1, 2 3, 4, 5,

465
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,100
6, 7, 8, 9.

466
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,070
So if I look at the order
here, g moved from 5 to 6,

467
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,090
but didn't change
order with respect

468
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,150
to any of the other guys.

469
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,040
Let's state that as a lemma.

470
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,490
Because that'll be very useful.

471
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:21,920
Lemma 1-- a row move
does not change the order

472
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,940
of the items or the letters.

473
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,590
Proof-- well, it's obvious.

474
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,640
No, you can't let me get
away with that, right?

475
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,490
Because I'm not to let you get
away with that on homework.

476
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,120
That's not so good.

477
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,140
So we've got to be a little
more careful in the proof here.

478
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,580
Otherwise, we just head
down the path to trouble.

479
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,520
So let's sort of specify,
what does a row move

480
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,450
mean-- just get a little bit
of math and specification

481
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,140
around it.

482
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:13,720
Well, in a row move,
we move an item--

483
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:23,680
a letter-- from some
cell i, whatever

484
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,170
i-- it could be anything 1
to 9-- into an adjacent cell.

485
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,720
What are the possibilities
for the adjacent cell?

486
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:50,120
Plus or minus 1, yeah, into
cell i minus 1 or i plus 1.

487
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,085
Nothing else moves.

488
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,920
Hence, the order of
the items is preserved.

489
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
Because if you're going
with i to i plus 1,

490
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,450
everything else is in i minus
1 or less, i plus 2 or more.

491
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,790
Relative order does not
change in this case.

492
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,570
And I'll claim that's enough.

493
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,910
You know that I've thought
about it a little bit.

494
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,820
I've really quantified that i
goes to i minus 1 or i plus 1.

495
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,460
Nothing else moves.

496
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,780
Therefore, we're done.

497
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,920
Now, I could've added
some more sentences here,

498
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,400
like I talked about.

499
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,050
But this is probably enough
in this case, for this guy.

500
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,400
So in fact, if we
only had row moves,

501
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,650
there's not much that happens.

502
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,184
The order never
changes with row moves.

503
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:58,100
So we never get there.

504
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,683
But column moves are
more interesting.

505
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:19,042
So as an example of a column
move, a, b, c, d, f, h, e,

506
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:23,220
g-- say I move the g up.

507
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:33,000
Then I would get this one--
a, b, c, d, f, g-- because g

508
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,420
moved up-- h, e.

509
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,550
So g went to there.

510
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,690
Did the ordering
change for this move?

511
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,300
Yeah.

512
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,450
How so?

513
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,570
What things changed order?

514
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,630
Which pairs of
letters changed order?

515
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:56,540
AUDIENCE: G changed [INAUDIBLE].

516
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,450
PROFESSOR: G changed by three--
moved three in the order.

517
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,837
And what letters did it
change relative order with?

518
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:07,831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

519
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,830
AUDIENCE: The two preceding it.

520
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
two preceding it.

521
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,790
g used to be after h and e.

522
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,070
Now it's before h and e.

523
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,750
All right, so it changed
relative order with two items.

524
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,300
It changed its
position by three.

525
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
It moved up three
in the ordering.

526
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,020
And so it changed order
with the two in between.

527
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,630
Let's look at another one.

528
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,760
Because we're really
doing these examples

529
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,190
to hunt for an
invariant, is what

530
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,530
we're trying to do
here-- something

531
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,710
that will let us prove we can
never get to the desired state.

532
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,750
Let's look at this one.

533
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:54,050
a, b, c, d, g, h,
e, f goes to-- I'm

534
00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:05,680
going to move b down this
time-- a, c, d, b, g, h, e, f.

535
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,225
So b moves down.

536
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,470
The relative order changes.

537
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,120
Which pairs got changed
in the relative order?

538
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,820
AUDIENCE: b.

539
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,264
PROFESSOR: b changed with--

540
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,430
AUDIENCE: c and [INAUDIBLE].

541
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,070
PROFESSOR: c and d.

542
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,380
b used to be before c and
d. when it moves down here,

543
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,160
it goes after c and d.

544
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,580
Any guess about what
Lemma Two is going to be?

545
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,544
What happens when we
make a column move?

546
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:41,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

547
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,192
PROFESSOR: Change the order of--

548
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

549
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,770
PROFESSOR: Good,
so a column move

550
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,971
changes the order of a
guy with the previous two

551
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:58,470
or the next two, which means
the relative order of two pairs

552
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,887
change.

553
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:01,220
So let's take that as Lemma Two.

554
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,660
When we say don't
do proof by example,

555
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,220
we don't mean
don't try examples.

556
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,300
Because by trying
examples, you find out

557
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,370
what you're trying to prove.

558
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,680
So that's good to do.

559
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:39,600
A column move changes the
relative order of precisely two

560
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,670
pairs of items.

561
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,750
So let's prove that.

562
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:12,010
In a column move, we move
an item in cell i for some i

563
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:22,642
to a blank spot in cell what?

564
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

565
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,334
PROFESSOR: i minus
3 or i plus 3?

566
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

567
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,590
PROFESSOR: OK, and just to
see that, let's draw out

568
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,340
the natural order.

569
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,890
I've got 1 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

570
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:46,690
Column moves could be here--
1 to 4, and 4 to 1, 2 and 5,

571
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,880
3 and 6, 4 and 7,
5 and 8, 6 and 9.

572
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,810
All 12 possible column
moves, this works for.

573
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,310
They're always separated by 3.

574
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:17,080
And when an item
moves three positions,

575
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,540
it changes relative order
with two other items.

576
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,950
And you can even write
down what they are.

577
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:36,942
It's i minus 1, i minus
2, or i plus 1, i plus 2.

578
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:38,650
Those are the guys it
changes order with.

579
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,100
All right, we've
got two lemmas here.

580
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,380
That one's done now.

581
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,100
In a row move, order
does not change.

582
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,070
In a column move, two pairs
of letters get flipped.

583
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,240
That's all you can do
with this puzzle now.

584
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,950
So can anybody
think of something

585
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,890
we can work with to get an
invariant here-- something

586
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,460
that won't change?

587
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,710
What we should be focusing on?

588
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,070
Yeah.

589
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,990
AUDIENCE: You can only switch
two pairs of items at a time.

590
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,380
So if you don't have an
even number [INAUDIBLE]

591
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,850
switch [INAUDIBLE].

592
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,199
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.

593
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,139
So really, to focus
in on there is,

594
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,600
if you have an even number
of things out of order

595
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,620
to start, you're going to
have an even number forever,

596
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,860
because you can only
change two at a time.

597
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,820
That's a great idea.

598
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,159
Let's really specify that
now, and define that.

599
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:52,420
A pair of letters or items,
call them L1 and L2--

600
00:34:52,420 --> 00:35:12,520
they form an inversion, also
known as an inverted pair,

601
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:24,160
if L1 precedes L2
in the alphabet,

602
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,140
but L1 appears after
L2 in the puzzle.

603
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,470
All right, so that
is an inversion.

604
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,960
So for example, let's
see how many inversions

605
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,060
do we have in this case?

606
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:57,850
We've got a, b,
c, f, d, g, e, h.

607
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,550
How many inversions are there
in that state of the puzzle?

608
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,070
Yeah?

609
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,950
AUDIENCE: Three.

610
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,908
PROFESSOR: Three, good.

611
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,866
And what are they?

612
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,130
AUDIENCE: d is after f.

613
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, d,
f is an inversion.

614
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,600
e, f is an inversion.

615
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,480
And what's the last one?

616
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,250
AUDIENCE: e, g.

617
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,320
PROFESSOR: e, g is an inversion.

618
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,430
Yes, so the answer is
there's three inversions

619
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,680
in this puzzle.

620
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,960
And if I keep doing
row and column

621
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,200
moves to this, what do
I know about the parity

622
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,746
of the number of inversions?

623
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:50,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

624
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,040
PROFESSOR: Will always be odd--
that's sort of interesting.

625
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:02,180
OK, now, how many inverted pairs
are there in the start state

626
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,100
way back over here?

627
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,440
How many inverted pairs here?

628
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,215
One inversion.

629
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,986
How many inversions here?

630
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:18,485
Zero.

631
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,350
All right, and can you see where
we're going to head here now?

632
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:32,080
If I started with
one, that's odd.

633
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,190
And every time I do a
row move or column move,

634
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,750
it's going to stay odd.

635
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,930
And I can never get here.

636
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,190
Is that clear what
we're trying to do?

637
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,380
So let's keep doing it.

638
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,350
Let's go over here.

639
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,510
All right, so now we'll
use Lemma One and Lemma Two

640
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,820
create this notion that we only
change the number of inversions

641
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,883
by an even number.

642
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:28,130
And Lemma Three-- during a
move, the number of inversions

643
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:42,500
can only increase by
two, decrease by two,

644
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,230
or stay the same.

645
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,210
And this proof is pretty easy.

646
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,060
There's a couple of cases.

647
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,250
In a row move, what happens?

648
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,380
How does the number
of inversions

649
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,629
change in a row move?

650
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:06,670
AUDIENCE: Stays the same.

651
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,770
PROFESSOR: Stays the
same-- no changes--

652
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,090
and that's by Lemma One.

653
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,725
Now, in a column move,
there's three cases.

654
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,432
But we know two pairs
change order-- that we know.

655
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:30,140
That's Lemma Two.

656
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,700
All right, by Lemma
Two, we know that.

657
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,857
But the three cases are-- let
me start on the next board.

658
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,850
So Case A is that both
of the inverted pairs

659
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:14,030
were in order originally,
before the column move.

660
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,720
What happens to the number
of inversions in this case,

661
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,588
as a result of the column move?

662
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:21,777
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

663
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:22,860
PROFESSOR: Goes up by two.

664
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,080
Case B is that both
pairs were inverted

665
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,250
before I made the column move.

666
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,994
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

667
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:39,179
AUDIENCE: Decreases by two.

668
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,220
PROFESSOR: Decreases by
two-- they were in order,

669
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,700
so they were inverted.

670
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,010
Now when I flop them,
they become in order.

671
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,470
So inversions drops by two.

672
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,650
And Case C is
there's one of each.

673
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,010
One of the pairs was inverted.

674
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,870
The other wasn't.

675
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,040
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

676
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

677
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,321
PROFESSOR: Yes, stays the same.

678
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,339
All right, and we're done.

679
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,880
That's what the lemma says-- I
can go up by two, down by two,

680
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,990
or stay the same.

681
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,820
All right, now a simple
corollary of this

682
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,200
is that during a move, the
parity-- i.e. even or odd

683
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,750
of the number of
inversions stays the same.

684
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,870
It can't change at all.

685
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:45,840
During a move, the parity--
and the parity means even, odd.

686
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,590
Sometimes it's called
0, 1, but the evenness

687
00:41:50,590 --> 00:42:01,460
and the oddness of the number
of inversions does not change.

688
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:11,420
AUDIENCE: Instead of two pairs
you mean one pair, right?

689
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,902
PROFESSOR: Where?

690
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:15,760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pairs.

691
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,530
PROFESSOR: Oops, I mean
one pair's inverted,

692
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,984
one pair's not.

693
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:20,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

694
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,860
PROFESSOR: No, I mean two pairs
change order in a column move.

695
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,600
Let's go back and look at that.

696
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,980
So I'm doing a column move.

697
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,490
For example, g goes up.

698
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,470
g, h changes order.

699
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,320
g, e changes order.

700
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,610
g changes order
with these two guys,

701
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,830
so there's two pairs
that got flipped.

702
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,230
So in a column move, two
pairs reverse their order.

703
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,240
If they were in order,
they become inverted.

704
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,792
If they were inverted,
they become in order.

705
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:57,625
Any other questions?

706
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,350
Yeah.

707
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,270
AUDIENCE: So we're saying
that letters can be

708
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,160
numbers in more than one pair?

709
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,470
PROFESSOR: Yes, a letter
can be in-- a letter

710
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:13,250
is in seven pairs, because
there's seven other letters.

711
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:19,000
And in fact, we're looking
at a space of 8 times 7

712
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,195
divided by 2-- 28
pairs of letters.

713
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:26,237
So there could be 28 inversions
if they're all out of order.

714
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,070
Any other questions?

715
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,230
OK, well, we're getting there.

716
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,980
We're almost done.

717
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,720
I've got to prove this
corollary that during a move,

718
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,210
the evenness or oddness of
the number of inversions

719
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,920
does not change.

720
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,410
And that's because adding or
subtracting 2 from a number

721
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,440
does not change its parity.

722
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,780
It stays odd or stays even.

723
00:43:51,780 --> 00:44:03,450
So adding or subtracting 2
does not change the parity.

724
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:14,070
All right, now we're ready
to state the invariant.

725
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,930
Anybody tell me what the
invariant is going to be?

726
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,805
What's the invariant going
to be in this system?

727
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

728
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the parity
of the number of inversions

729
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,650
is odd, because it
starts that way.

730
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,960
It's preserved.

731
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,720
And it won't hold in
the desired end state

732
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,182
that we're looking at.

733
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:48,515
So we can state that as follows.

734
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:05,810
In every state or
configuration reachable

735
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:13,530
from the start
state, which is a,

736
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:21,160
b, c, d, e, f, h, g--
which are out of order--

737
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:30,690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

738
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,440
And the proof will
be by induction.

739
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,750
And invariant proofs
are always by induction.

740
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,100
And the inductive
hypothesis-- and this

741
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,270
is very typical in
a proof by using

742
00:45:52,270 --> 00:46:11,910
invariants-- is, so P of n is
after any sequence of n moves

743
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:17,260
from the start state-- in
fact, just the rest of this

744
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,020
is what it is.

745
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,280
All right, so our inductive
hypothesis is P of n,

746
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,510
after any sequence of n moves--
so n is the number of moves

747
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,510
you took to get there--
from the start state,

748
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,550
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

749
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,180
That is the
inductive hypothesis.

750
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,680
This is the invariant.

751
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,380
And they become
one and the same.

752
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,960
And the parameter n is the
number of moves you've taken.

753
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,625
And that's how you set up
a proof using an invariant.

754
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,774
It always looks just like this.

755
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,220
OK, so we're doing a
proof by induction.

756
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,720
We've got the
inductive hypothesis.

757
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,837
What's the next step?

758
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:25,670
AUDIENCE: Base case.

759
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,545
PROFESSOR: Base case.

760
00:47:32,456 --> 00:47:34,830
And in these circumstances,
where the proof by invariant,

761
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,590
the base case is always 0.

762
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,020
We haven't made any moves yet.

763
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,860
Now in this case, if
we haven't made moves,

764
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:48,870
the number of inversions in
the start state now is 1.

765
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:55,380
That means the parity is
odd, and the hypothesis

766
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,230
is satisfied.

767
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,650
P of 0 is true, because in
any sequence of zero moves,

768
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,092
after this-- i.e.

769
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:03,800
in this state-- you've
got one inversion.

770
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,602
That's odd.

771
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:08,815
The last step is
the inductive step.

772
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:22,510
And here we need to show for
any n bigger or equal to 0,

773
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:29,980
we need to show P of n implies
p of n plus 1 is true--

774
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,990
the standard thing.

775
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,770
So let's look at P n plus 1.

776
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,260
That's talking
about where we are

777
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,550
after a sequence of n plus
1 moves in the puzzle,

778
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,610
from the start state.

779
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:58,790
So let's consider any
sequence of n plus 1 moves.

780
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,545
And call these
moves-- label them

781
00:49:00,545 --> 00:49:05,394
by M1 all the way to M n plus 1.

782
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:06,560
Those are the moves we made.

783
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,680
Now, by the inductive
hypothesis, because of P n,

784
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,720
we know that after the first n
moves, the parity is still odd.

785
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,170
That's what P n says.

786
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:20,980
That's P n.

787
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,774
After any sequence
of n moves from here,

788
00:49:24,774 --> 00:49:26,690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

789
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,460
So we could say by the
inductive hypothesis,

790
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:48,450
or we could say by P n, we know
that the parity after moves

791
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:54,340
M1 out to M n is odd.

792
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,240
Now, by Corollary One-- do
we still have Corollary One?

793
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,724
[INAUDIBLE]

794
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:07,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

795
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,140
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE], yeah,
good, we've got Corollary One.

796
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,650
During any move, the
parity doesn't change.

797
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:19,190
That says from after the nth
move to after the n plus 1st

798
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,141
move-- one extra move--
doesn't change the parity.

799
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:22,890
So it's still odd.

800
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:50,080
So next, by Corollary
One, we know

801
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:59,010
that the parity of the
number of inversions

802
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,840
does not change
during M n plus 1.

803
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:25,710
Therefore, this implies that
the parity after all n plus 1

804
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:35,340
moves-- these guys-- is odd.

805
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,180
It started odd.

806
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,150
It stayed odd after the first n.

807
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,580
It stayed odd during
the n plus 1st.

808
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,940
So it's odd.

809
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,780
And that's exactly the
statement of P n plus 1.

810
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,740
So we've completed
the induction.

811
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,247
We've shown that P n
implies P n plus 1.

812
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:01,241
All right, so now, any
questions so far on this?

813
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:01,989
Yeah.

814
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,947
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between a lemma

815
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:05,300
and a corollary?

816
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,440
PROFESSOR: Really, there's
not a lot of difference.

817
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,450
Corollary usually
is something that's

818
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,870
a simple consequence
of something else.

819
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,734
And the corollary had
a pretty short proof.

820
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,150
Usually when you see corollary,
that's not a 10-page proof

821
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,770
there.

822
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,410
A lemma is something
that you're going

823
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,010
to use as a tool for
a bigger thing, often

824
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,060
a theorem or another lemma.

825
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,970
In fact, now we're going to
get to the theorem, which

826
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,820
is sort of the final thing--
the thing we're really after.

827
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,315
And that's sort of the big deal.

828
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:35,690
And now the proof
will be simple,

829
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,512
because we've done all these
lemmas and corollaries.

830
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:39,345
Any other questions?

831
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,840
All right.

832
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,170
In fact, the theorem
is up here, right?

833
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,040
There is no sequence of legal
moves to invert g and h.

834
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,950
In other words, the
students were screwed.

835
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,060
They couldn't do it fairly.

836
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,400
So let's prove the theorem now.

837
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:39,030
The parity of the
number of inversions

838
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,520
in the desired state-- i.e.

839
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:51,050
in order-- the target
state-- is even.

840
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,160
Nothing's out of order.

841
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,320
There's zero inversions.

842
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:07,030
By Lemma Four, the desired
state cannot be reached from

843
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:26,450
the start state, because
its parity is odd,

844
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:27,750
using legal moves.

845
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,420
So we're done.

846
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,290
So the proof of the
theorem-- by now,

847
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,200
it's short, because we did four
lemmas, a corollary, and lots

848
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:34,790
of argument.

849
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:43,010
Could you have solved the puzzle
if I allow the blank to be

850
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,680
somewhere else at the end?

851
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,250
Is the puzzle solvable then?

852
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,250
No.

853
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:52,790
Why not?

854
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,105
Doesn't impact the parity at
all, so you can't do that.

855
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,300
Again, the idea
here-- and you'll

856
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,850
get some practice
in homework-- is

857
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,140
you're looking for a property
that holds at the beginning,

858
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,400
is preserved by every
step, but is not

859
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,190
present in the target state.

860
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,980
Now actually, this puzzle
was enormously popular

861
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,260
in the late 1880s.

862
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,260
In fact there was $1,000
prize offered for anybody

863
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,640
who could solve
the larger version.

864
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,310
Back then, it was the 15
puzzle, which you can still

865
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,740
buy today-- same problem
on a 4 by 4 grid--

866
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,150
exactly the same problem.

867
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,470
A pair is out of order.

868
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,430
You've got to get them in order.

869
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,510
You can't do it.

870
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,460
Now, the proof
you can't do it is

871
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,210
a little harder-- same
idea-- one extra idea

872
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,570
in it-- one extra lemma.

873
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,080
And that's for homework.

874
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,700
So you'll go through and
see exactly the structure

875
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,360
with one extra little trick it.

876
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,177
But back then, I guess most
people didn't-- of course,

877
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:04,010
most people didn't
realize it wasn't doable.

878
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,250
So they could offer
this price safely.

879
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:11,130
$1,000 then is probably worth a
quarter million dollars today.

880
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,440
Any questions on
the eight puzzle?

881
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,624
Yeah.

882
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:19,261
AUDIENCE: The
inductive steps-- when

883
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:23,064
you said, "by inductive
hypothesis," [INAUDIBLE] parity

884
00:56:23,064 --> 00:56:27,465
after, shouldn't the
first term be M0?

885
00:56:27,465 --> 00:56:28,340
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

886
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,250
No, the first move is M1.

887
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,410
The second is M2.

888
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,859
Now, when I talk
about zero moves,

889
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,400
that means no moves
are taking place.

890
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,970
I'm still in the start state.

891
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,920
So a move is a transition
between states.

892
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,160
So you could have state 0.

893
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,556
That's the start state.

894
00:56:45,556 --> 00:56:49,685
State one would be the
move after move one.

895
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:50,810
Have I got that right here?

896
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:56,550
So the inductive step, I need
to show P0 zero implies P1.

897
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,070
P1 implies P2, and so forth.

898
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:03,620
And P n is the parity of
inversions after n moves.

899
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,670
So you could have state s0.

900
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,835
We didn't label the states here,
but you could have state s0.

901
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:13,817
Yeah.

902
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:17,499
AUDIENCE: So in this problem,
we assume that everything should

903
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:20,830
be defined as rows or columns.

904
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:25,454
How do we know when the
assumptions are valid?

905
00:57:25,454 --> 00:57:26,870
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

906
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:31,071
OK, so really,
there's two cases.

907
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:32,570
To be really precise,
we should have

908
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:35,510
argued there's only two types of
moves, a row move and a column

909
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:36,037
move.

910
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:38,620
And in fact, if you look at what
can move into a blank square,

911
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,919
there's four guys that
can do it-- the guy above,

912
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,460
the guy to the right, the guy
to the left, and the guy below.

913
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,549
Two of those are row
moves, two are columns.

914
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,590
So that's right-- to really
pin down the details,

915
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,696
we should have checked those
are the only two possible moves.

916
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:53,320
And if there was a third kind of
move that I hadn't considered,

917
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,860
this proof would be bogus.

918
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,290
That's a good question.

919
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,141
Any other questions?

920
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,880
OK.

921
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,142
Now, I think
probably, you see why

922
00:58:07,142 --> 00:58:08,350
the invariants are important.

923
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:12,290
But say that someday,
you're building software

924
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,762
to run a nuclear reactor.

925
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:16,470
Now, there's a certain
state you'd really

926
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:19,530
like to avoid-- meltdown.

927
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,310
And you'd like to
be able to prove

928
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:25,220
that, in any sequence of moves
that happen in your reactor

929
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,800
program, you never reach
the meltdown state.

930
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,160
Well you'd use
invariants to do that.

931
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,950
Or if you're building
software for an airplane,

932
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,400
you'd like to never
reach the crash state.

933
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,860
Or if you're building
a radiation device,

934
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,330
you never want to get in the
state that fries the patient.

935
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:48,425
So this is an important notion.

936
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,800
So for the rest
of the day, we're

937
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,470
going to talk about a
different kind of induction

938
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:55,390
called strong induction.

939
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,020
It's very similar to
ordinary induction,

940
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:02,970
but it's a little easier to use
when solving certain problems.

941
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,820
Now like regular
induction, strong induction

942
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,908
can be expressed with an axiom.

943
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,594
So let me show you the
strong induction axiom.

944
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,420
You have a predicate,
P n, like before.

945
00:59:54,570 --> 01:00:04,840
If P0 is true-- your base
case-- and for all n,

946
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,330
it's not P n implies P
n plus 1, it's P0 and P1

947
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:19,430
and dot, dot, dot, and P n
are all true, then P n plus 1.

948
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:29,242
If this is true for all n,
then P n is true for all n.

949
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,470
Now, the only difference
between strong induction

950
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:46,380
and ordinary induction that
we did last time is this part.

951
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,220
In ordinary induction,
you're showing

952
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,830
that P n implies P n plus 1.

953
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,360
In strong induction, you're
showing that all these facts

954
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,880
put together imply P n plus 1.

955
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,810
Now, to show
implication, remember,

956
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:08,234
you get to assume that
all these things are true.

957
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:10,150
So you know how in
ordinary induction, we say,

958
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:13,890
"assume P n is true and you're
going to prove P n plus 1?"

959
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:17,440
In strong induction, you get
to say, "assume P n is true,

960
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,070
P n minus 1 is true, dot,
dot, dot, P1 is true,

961
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,840
and P0 is true.

962
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,650
You get to assume a lot more.

963
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,810
So it's a stronger
proof technique,

964
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,520
because it allows you to do
more-- or so you would think.

965
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,162
Now in fact, any proof you
can do with strong induction,

966
01:01:34,162 --> 01:01:35,620
you can do with
ordinary induction.

967
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,990
It just might be harder.

968
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,600
So you can't prove
any more with it,

969
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,300
but it makes your
proofs much easier.

970
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,133
And we're going to do
an example in a minute

971
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,320
where the proof is
much easier by getting

972
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,330
to assume all of these
things are true in order

973
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,880
to prove P n plus 1.

974
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,990
Are there any questions
about the difference here

975
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,150
with strong induction-- that
now you get to assume all these

976
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:01,910
are true as part of
the inductive step?

977
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:02,410
All right.

978
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,410
Our first example of
a strong induction

979
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,210
is going to be a simple game.

980
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,380
We've got a stack of
eight blocks here.

981
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,680
Now, in this game,
what you're going to do

982
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:21,490
is divide the stack
into two sub-stacks.

983
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:25,470
So I just took eight, and
split it into three and five.

984
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:30,390
For that move, you get
15 points-- 3 times 5.

985
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,490
Let's write that down.

986
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,450
OK, so this is called
the Unstacking Game.

987
01:02:54,810 --> 01:03:02,140
And in the first move, we
went 8 split to 5 and 3.

988
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,940
And that's worth 15 points.

989
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:12,100
Now in the next move, I'm going
to split the stack of five

990
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,160
into four and one.

991
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,760
And for that, you get
4 points-- 4 times 1.

992
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:26,610
And I keep on going until I
have a stacks of height one.

993
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,270
And the last move, I'll be
splitting a two into two ones.

994
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,810
That'll give me one point.

995
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:35,080
Then I add up all the points,
and that's your score.

996
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,630
And the goal is to get
the most number of points

997
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,200
when you add up
the entire score.

998
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,730
Now, just so this game is
clear, we're going to play it.

999
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,049
And I'm going to
raise the stakes here.

1000
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:49,590
What we're going to
do is we're going

1001
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,980
to have a competition
between three members

1002
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,610
of the class and the TAs.

1003
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:00,020
Now, if the class team
wins-- they get more points--

1004
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,720
we're going to give
everybody in the class candy.

1005
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,340
And I've got lots of candy here.

1006
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,668
If the TAs beat you,
they get the candy.

1007
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:11,610
AUDIENCE: What if it's a tie?

1008
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,679
PROFESSOR: We'll
figure that out.

1009
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:14,720
We'll come to that later.

1010
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,140
But you want to win this thing.

1011
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,216
So I need some
volunteers from the class

1012
01:04:18,216 --> 01:04:19,340
who think they can do well.

1013
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,030
Yeah, come on down.

1014
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,740
You two guys come on down.

1015
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,000
All right, TAs come on up.

1016
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,760
Now, I want you
to make some noise

1017
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,796
if you think your three class
reps here can beat the TAs.

1018
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:38,102
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1019
01:04:38,102 --> 01:04:40,970
All right, how many
people-- make some noise you

1020
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,540

1021
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,212
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

1022
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,420
PROFESSOR: Ooh, that's nasty.

1023
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,180
It must've been a rough
recitation last week

1024
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,930
on Wednesday.

1025
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,884
All right, so let's see.

1026
01:04:50,884 --> 01:04:52,800
I think we're going to
let the class go first.

1027
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,160
This is your stack.

1028
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,270
Now think about what move
you want to make first,

1029
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,750
because that matters.

1030
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,630
And you guys can give them
some advice if you want,

1031
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,887
as to the move they
should make first.

1032
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:04,470
And I'm going to
keep score over here.

1033
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,070
Oh, OK, they went
for the maximum move.

1034
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:11,580
That's good.

1035
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:16,160
They realized 4 times
4 is 16-- very good.

1036
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,705
So let's write that up here.

1037
01:05:19,705 --> 01:05:23,380
You're Off to a good start.

1038
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,370
In fact, that's the
maximum number of points

1039
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:28,720
for the first move,
I think-- good job.

1040
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,490
All right, so here's
the class here.

1041
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,640
And here are the TAs.

1042
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:48,135
And the class went 8 into
4 by 4, and they got 16.

1043
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,340
Now, the TAs are working
hard here, as you can see.

1044
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,890
And they've got a move.

1045
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,910
That's a pretty pathetic
first move for the TAs.

1046
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,230
Looking good for the
candy for you guys.

1047
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,980
They got 7 points for the TAs.

to do for your next move?

obviously better than ours.

figured it out already.

convinced they're going to lose.

Three and one, OK,
good, interesting.

1066
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:53,320
So we have three and one.

1067
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,110
That gives you 3 points.

1068
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,000
All right, TAs, we need a move.

1069
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:08,000
All right, so they've gone
six and one-- 6 points.

you're dead already?

So you're up to 22.

know how to do this best?

pick up 2 more here.

They're already

In fact, you can't beat 28.

And you can't do
worse than 28, either.

Because every strategy gives 28.

have to throw it to the class

get the candy.

produce the same score.

It wasn't a coincidence for 8.

1170

And the score, we'll call it
S of n for the n-block game.

1171

to show that S of 8 was 28.

do you think we're

01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,882
You've gone a step ahead there.

1190
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:41,090
So I'm going to start with
this as being a predicate,

1191
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,150
because I'm trying to
show they're all the same.

1192
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,400
And I haven't figured out
what the scores going to be.

1193
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,970
But I think you're already
on a good track here for what

1194
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:50,410
the score is going to be.

1195
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,948
Now we do the base case.

1196
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,770
So we take n equals
1-- the one-block game.

1197
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,130
S of 1 is 0.

1198
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,170
We never took a move.

1199
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,080
We never got a score.

1200
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,150
There was only one block.

1201
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:10,560
We ended before we started.

1202
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,680
So that's OK.

1203
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,235
And now we have
the inductive step.

1204
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:29,510
And here we get to assume P1,
P2, all the way up to P n,

1205
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,610
to prove P n plus 1.

1206
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:41,791
And so now we look
at n plus 1 blocks,

1207
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,040
because that's we're starting.

1208
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,890
So we have n plus 1,
and we split it somehow.

1209
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,500
And it could be any split.

1210
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,700
We might have K on one
side, then n plus 1 minus K

1211
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,727
on the other side for
any K between 1 and n.

1212
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:08,660
And let's figure out our
score for that scenario.

1213
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,170
Well, we get the
product of these numbers

1214
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,060
for the first step.

1215
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:24,100
We get K times n plus 1
minus K for the first step.

1216
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,750
And then as we recurse,
and we split up

1217
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,300
that block of K blocks,
how many points do we

1218
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,030
get for splitting
that all the way down?

1219
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:34,900
AUDIENCE: P of K.

1220
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,191
PROFESSOR: P of K, because
that's the induction.

1221
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:39,315
We assume that as part of
the induction hypothesis.

1222
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,080
And how many points do
we get for splitting

1223
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,260
this stack all the way down?

1224
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:55,590
Yeah, P of n plus 1 minus K.

1225
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,330
And you see why
strong induction's

1226
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:00,310
coming in handy here?

1227
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:02,990
For the TA's strategy,
K would be 1.

1228
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,099
We know P of 1 is 0.

1229
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,890
And you would just need
ordinary induction.

1230
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,760
This would be P of n.

1231
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,300
But for a general strategy,
it could be any split.

1232
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,110
So we need to have all
these assumed here.

1233
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:18,330
It makes it much easier
when using strong induction.

1234
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,310
All right, so this
is our total score

1235
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:23,180
for the game for
n plus 1 blocks.

1236
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,240
And we're trying to show
it just depends on n,

1237
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:33,149
and that it doesn't depend
on K. Does that depend on K?

1238
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,210
Looks like it to me, right?

1239
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:44,020
I got K in every single term.

1240
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:44,740
So I'm not there.

1241
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,240
I'm stuck.

1242
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,939
You see why I'm stuck?

1243
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:51,230
Because I'd like to be able
to say that the score I get

1244
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:54,120
for the n plus one
block game-- this

1245
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,520
is S n plus 1-- is the same
for any sequence of moves.

1246
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,260
It doesn't even depend on
K. But I can't do that.

1247
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,310
What do you do when you're
stuck with an induction proof?

1248
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,460
What's one of the tricks?

1249
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,584
AUDIENCE: Make it stronger.

1250
01:18:07,584 --> 01:18:09,800
PROFESSOR: Make
it stronger, which

1251
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,360
means I get a stronger
induction hypothesis.

1252
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,030
Now, somebody gave me
one up there before.

1253
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,196
How could I strengthen my
induction hypothesis here?

1254
01:18:22,052 --> 01:18:23,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1255
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,320
PROFESSOR: Give the
formula for S n-- that

1256
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,360
would make it stronger.

1257
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,140
I tell you what it is.

1258
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,760
What's a good guess
for the formula here?

1259
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,700
AUDIENCE: Factorial.

1260
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:41,580
PROFESSOR: Factorial-- Well,
is S of 8 equal 8 factorial?

1261
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,234
No, not so good.

1262
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:46,631
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

1263
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:48,130
AUDIENCE: n equals
n minus 1 over 2.

1264
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:51,510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a better guess--

1265
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:56,160
equals n times n minus 1 over 2.

1266
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,750
And in fact, what's
8 times 7 over 2?

1267
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,330
It's 28.

1268
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,770
It works here.

1269
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:02,770
Let's check another one.

1270
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,520
What's S of 2?

1271
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:07,670
AUDIENCE: 1.

1272
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:12,740
PROFESSOR: 1-- well, 2
times 1 over 2-- it works.

1273
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,690
What's S of 3?

1274
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,130
2 the first move, then 1 more.

1275
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:26,340
3-- 3 times 2 over
2 is 3-- looks good.

1276
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,430
So now I've got a stronger
induction hypothesis.

1277
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,220
Not only is it
always the same, it

1278
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,710
is that number is your score.

1279
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,190
Let's see if that works.

1280
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:38,000
Let's plug that in now.

1281
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,560
So base case--
let's check it out--

1282
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:47,520
is 1 times 1 minus
1 over 2 equal to 0.

1283
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,750
Yes.

1284
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:53,040
Let's plug it in here now.

1285
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:58,570
P of K would be now
K, K minus 1 over 2.

1286
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:08,220
This would be n plus 1 minus K,
n minus K over 2 plus this one

1287
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:08,720
here.

1288
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,850
All right, I've got to add
all these things up, and see

1289
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:19,473
if it equals that
expression for n plus 1.

1290
01:20:19,473 --> 01:20:20,435
Let's do that.

1291
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:29,780
All right, I get 2 K n
plus 2 K minus 2 K squared.

1292
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,920
I'm putting all this over 2--
one giant mess over 2 here--

1293
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:43,120
plus K squared minus
K plus n squared.

1294
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:52,940
Well, let's write it just as
n plus 1 times n, minus K n,

1295
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:57,860
minus K, minus K n, all over 2.

1296
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,770
And now let's cancel.

1297
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:04,420
Two K n's here cancel K n, K n.

1298
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:12,310
2K cancels K and K. 2K
squared minus 2 K squared

1299
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:14,070
cancels K squared.

1300
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:20,970
And I forgot, plus K
squared from here and here.

1301
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:25,040
So I'm left with n
plus 1 times n over 2.

1302
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,450
That is S n plus 1.

1303
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,770
And the K disappears.

1304
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:34,740
We've established, now, the
stronger induction hypothesis.

1305
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:38,980
So not only did we prove
that every set of unstackings

1306
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,960
gives you the same score.

1307
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,010
We proved the score is, for
n blocks, n times n minus 1

1308
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:46,570
over 2.

1309
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:51,620
That's was pretty good
for strong induction.

1310
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,710
It lets you do some
pretty powerful things.

1311
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:56,820
OK, very good,
that's it for today.
