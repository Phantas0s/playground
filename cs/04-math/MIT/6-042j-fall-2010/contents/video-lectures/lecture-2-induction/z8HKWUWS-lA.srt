8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,310
PROFESSOR: Last week we talked
about the key components

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,380
of a proof, propositions,
axioms, and logical deductions,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,580
and as you probably talked
about during recitation,

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,180
we're not going
to worry too much

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,360
about what axioms or logical
deductions that you use.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,490
Anything that is
reasonable, is fine by us.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,240
We're not going to ask you
to know what modus ponens is,

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,420
or to label some law when
you make a logical deduction.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,360
Just, you know, be reasonable.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,860
Any facts you knew coming into
this course about mathematics,

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,470
probably close enough
to use as an axiom.

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,440
Want to make sure your axioms
are consistent, but that's OK.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,160
Now the exception to this would
be, is say we're on an exam,

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,080
and we ask you to prove
some proposition, p.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,730
Well you can't say, I already
knew p, it's an axiom, check.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,550
That's not so good.

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,710
We're asking you to
prove it from some more

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,060
elementary facts.

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,980
OK it's also don't want me
making wild leaps of faith,

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,130
or saying it's obvious that,
unless it really is obvious.

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,920
That kind of stuff can
get you in trouble.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,470
Much better to sort of explain
the reasoning in the proof.

30
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,480
Now the proofs that we covered
last week in recitation,

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,840
the problems set,
were all examples

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,140
of what are called
direct proofs.

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,820
You start with some axioms,
you have some theorems

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,100
you knew before or you
proved along the way,

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,960
and you make logical
deductions until you

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
get to where you want
to go, the theorem.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,980
We're going to start today
with an indirect proof.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,360
For example, a proof
by contradiction.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,320
And this is a little
bit different.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,740
In a proof by contradiction,
you assume the opposite

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,350
of what you're trying to prove.

42
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,570
Then you just take steps
for logical deductions

43
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,610
forward until you arrive
at a contradiction,

44
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,920
something where you
prove false equals true.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,420
Now if you can ever
get to the point

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,830
we approve something
is false and true,

47
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,750
that means what you assumed
at the start had to be wrong.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,680
Namely, what you're trying
to prove has to be true.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,180
So let's write that
down, because it

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,800
can be a little
confusing the first time.

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:49,000
So to prove a
proposition p is true,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,060
you will assume that it's false.

53
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,380
In other words,
that not p is true.

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:19,630
And then you use that
hypothesis, namely the p

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:27,040
is false, to derive a falsehood.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,590
In other words, you prove
a falsehood is true.

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,290
And this is called
deriving a contradiction.

58
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,720
And so it must be that,
in fact, p is not false,

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,980
namely that it's true.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,410
Now this works because
if you can prove,

61
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:59,660
if not p implies false is
true, well from last time,

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,530
the only way this is a true
statement is if this is false,

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,740
namely p is true.

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,240
All right?

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,520
So we can conclude
that p is true,

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,850
if we can show that not
P implies a falsehood.

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,779
Any questions about that?

68
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,860
It's sort of a lot
of sort of notation,

69
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,300
and until you've seen,
it can be confusing.

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,970
So maybe we should
do an example.

71
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,005
Let's prove that square
root of 2 is irrational.

72
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:40,550
Is irrational.

73
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,290
OK, everybody knows what
an irrational number is?

74
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,090
That's something that
can't be expressed

75
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,321
as the ratio of integers.

76
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,820
OK, and probably
most people already

77
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,300
know that-- how
many people have not

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,780
seen a proof that square root
of 2 is a rational before?

79
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,820
So most of you have seen
a proof of that, good.

80
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,945
You know, if you try to do
a direct proof for this,

81
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:06,840
it's pretty hard.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,900
How do you show there's
no way to represent

83
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,950
the square root of 2 is
as integers a over b?

84
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,040
But it's very easy, if we
do a proof by contradiction.

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,010
Now when you're doing a
proof by contradiction,

86
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,540
always start off by
saying, by contradiction.

87
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,910
Write that down.

88
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,140
And then what you
do next is you say,

89
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:41,690
I'm going to assume, for the
purpose of contradiction,

90
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,350
that p is false and
when not p is true.

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,365
In this case, that would be
square root of 2 is rational.

92
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,520
So in this case, here's
what we're trying to prove.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,730
That's p.

94
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm going to assume not p,
namely that square root of 2

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,570
is irrational number.

96
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,830
Then I'm going to get a
contradiction or falsehood,

97
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,540
and then I'm going to know
that p was true after all.

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,250
All right, so let's see
where this leads us.

99
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,980
Well, if square root
of 2 is rational

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,850
then we can express it as
a over b, where a over b

101
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,325
is a fraction in lowest terms.

102
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,415
That means a and b have
no common divisors.

103
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,720
And then I can
square both sides,

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,850
and I get two is a
squared over b squared.

105
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,100
Then I multiply by
b squared, and I get

106
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,900
2b squared equals a squared.

107
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,340
And what does that
imply about a?

108
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,710
What can you tell me
about a if it equals--

109
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,080
if a squared is 2b squared?

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,910
Anything special about a?

111
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,460
Could a be anything?

112
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,180
A squared is even, all right?

113
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,360
Because 2b squared is an even
number, so a squared is even,

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,605
and what does that mean about a?

115
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,140
A is even.

116
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,570
B squared is even,
then a is even.

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,860
So a is even.

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,080
So we could write
that as two divides a.

119
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,250
That's the divide symbol.

120
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,700
You'll see a lot
of that next week.

121
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,940
All right if a is even, what
do I know about a squared?

122
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,340
I know more than
just, it's even.

123
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,510
What is it?

124
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,160
It's multiple of 4, yeah.

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,030
So that means that
four divides a squared.

126
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,150
A squared is 2b
squared, so that means

127
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,970
that four divides 2b squared.

128
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,780
Divide each side by 2
means 2 divides b squared.

129
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,418
What does that imply about b?

130
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:10,870
B is even.

131
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,750
All right, b is even, good.

132
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,620
Well, I've got a is
even and b is even.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,225
I got a contradiction
here, somewhere?

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,260
Yeah a over b was not a
fraction in lowest terms,

135
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,410
because both and b are even.

136
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:41,565
All right, so that implies a
over b is not in lowest terms.

137
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,500
And that is a contradiction.

138
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,660
Now you'll see that
written lots of ways.

139
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,410
One is, you can say
a contradiction,

140
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,586
sometimes you'll see just
this sharp symbol written,

141
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:59,460
and that means you've
got to a contradiction.

142
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,510
Because here, we had it
being in lowest terms,

143
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,260
and here we have it
not in lowest terms.

144
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,801
You can't have both
at the same time,

145
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,910
so you got a contradiction.

146
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,080
And that means we've now proved
that this assumption was wrong.

147
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,750
Square root of 2
is not rational,

148
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,840
so it must be irrational.

149
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,540
and then we put a little
box here at the end,

150
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,620
or sometimes you'll see
a check, sometimes you'll

151
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,910
see QED, that says
the proof's done now.

152
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,640
It's over.

153
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,790
Any questions about that proof?

154
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,740
We're going to do a lot of
proofs by contradiction.

155
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,630
Actually, there's an interesting
story behind this proof.

156
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,600
As far as we know, it was first
discovered by the Pythagoreans,

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,270
way back when in ancient Greece.

158
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,330
And the Pythagoreans
were a religious society

159
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,350
started by Pythagoras, of
Pythagoras theorem frame.

160
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,850
Now it sounds weird today, but
back then, in ancient Greece,

161
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,845
math was a religion, all right?

162
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,970
Every once in while you'll
see somebody around MIT,

163
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,920
and you'll think he must
think math is a religion,

164
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,860
but back then it really was,
and it was ruled by God,

165
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,620
because this is ancient Greece.

166
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,430
And there were two key gods
in this religion, Apeiron

167
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,790
and Peros.

168
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,730
Now Apeiron was the bad god,
and he was the god of infinity,

169
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,645
because infinity was
considered all that was bad.

170
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,020
And I don't think we'll do a
lot with infinity this term,

171
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,270
but if we do you'll appreciate
why that's the case.

172
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,540
And Peros was a good god.

173
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,580
He was the god of
the finite world,

174
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,570
and represented everything that
was good to the ancient Greeks.

175
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,930
Now one of their main
axioms, or beliefs,

176
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,290
was that there were
no irrational numbers.

177
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,070
They just didn't exist.

178
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,570
Now the reason is, they didn't
like irrational numbers.

179
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,690
They were bad.

180
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,420
Because, well they're infinite.

181
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,390
You can't write
them as a decimal

182
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,130
without repeating forever, and
you know, just an infinite sort

183
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,160
of decimal representation.

184
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,530
They liked rational numbers,
you know, like one seventh?

185
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,540
That's a good number,
because you can write it

186
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,330
as 0.142857 repeating.

187
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,370
So rational numbers
are finite, in that

188
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,100
you can always find a repeating
pattern of finite length.

189
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,540
Irrational numbers are not.

190
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,924
They're infinite in that
sense of the ancient Greeks.

191
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:30,840
So they said there were
no irrational numbers.

192
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,380
That was an early axiom.

193
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,810
Now they also had
an axiom that said

194
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,717
that every length of a line
was finite, therefore rational.

195
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,300
All right, you know
the ancient Greeks

196
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,130
were good with a compass,
and drawing lines

197
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,570
with straight edges and stuff.

198
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,090
So they said any line
that you can construct

199
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,270
has a finite length
to it, so therefore it

200
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,390
has a rational length.

201
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,740
That was axiom number two.

202
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,910
Now they were good geometers,
so they knew, of course,

203
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,070
they developed the
Pythagorean theorem.

204
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,520
But if you took a triangle,
and you have side lengths one,

205
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,177
the length of the hypotenuse
was square root 2.

206
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,760
Therefore they had
a theorem that said

207
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,946
square root 2 was rational.

208
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,430
Because you've got the
2 axioms there, right?

209
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,480
Now eventually, they
discovered a proof like that,

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,740
that it wasn't rational.

211
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,380
It was irrational.

212
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,010
This caused quite a stir.

213
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,180
First it meant that their
axioms were inconsistent.

214
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,590
Every theorem they
proved was now suspect,

215
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,600
once you have
inconsistent axioms.

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Even worse, the devil
is in their midst.

217
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,300
Square root 2 is
infinite is the bad god,

218
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,690
and this is the most basic
length they had, besides one.

219
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,849
So that's a very bad thing.

220
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,390
Sort of like, you
know, today we were

221
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,310
to wake up and discover
that there were only nine

222
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,950
commandments, and the 10th was
planted there by the devil.

223
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,710
And you're not sure
which one, maybe.

224
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,270
That would be a big
mess, sacrilege.

225
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,520
Well, so what were they to do?

226
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,370
This is a disaster
of major proportions.

227
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,490
So they covered it up, and
they denied the result.

228
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,570
So they didn't want
to publish that proof.

229
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,760
So they kept on saying
square root 2 was rational.

230
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,130
But then, according to legend
there was a Deep Throat.

231
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,339
Somebody who let out the word
and the proof the square root 2

232
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,630
is irrational, because that
would be very destabilizing

233
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,810
for the society, and
so they killed them.

234
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,042
This is the legend.

235
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,500
Now, hard to imagine
getting killed

236
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,505
over the irrationality of 2.

237
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,130
All right, we're
going to do a lot more

238
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,080
of these kind of
proofs in homework

239
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
and throughout the term.

240
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,750
The next proof I
want to show you

241
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,410
is one of my favorite
proof techniques.

242
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,950
One of my favorite proofs.

243
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,912
And that is a false proof.

244
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,370
And we're going to see a lot
of these during the term, too.

245
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,030
And if we could bring
the screens down.

246
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,420
Somebody back there to-- yeah.

247
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,730
Great.

248
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,313
Bring the screens
down, I'm going to--

249
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,750
and then turn this on for me.

250
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,160
So I'm going to prove to you
that 90 is bigger than 92.

251
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,660
All right?

252
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,360
And that hopefully,
is not really true.

253
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,470
But, you know, watch this
proof and see if there's

254
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,450
any problems with it.

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,016
All right, the
proof, by PowerPoint.

256
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,515
Right away you
should be suspicious.

257
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,004
I'm going to take two
triangles with total area 90

258
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,920
and put them together,
and then divide them up

259
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,110
into four triangles with
area greater than 92.

260
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,020
And by the conservation
of area axiom, which

261
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,230
you want to be maybe
thinking about,

262
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,110
this will imply an area of 90
is larger than an area of 92.

263
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,460
And therefore that
90 is bigger than 92.

264
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,900
All right, those
are my triangles.

265
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,150
They are right
triangles, 9 by 10.

266
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,510
If I put them together, I
get a 9 by 10 rectangle.

267
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,140
Of course it has
area 90, 9 times 10.

268
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,170
Now I'm going to slide these
triangles across their diagonal

269
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,620
so that I get, instead
of having 10 on the side,

270
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,030
I'm going to slide it
so I get a 2 and an 8.

271
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,560
OK I had 10 there
before, now it's 2 and 8.

272
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,060
And then you see
I've got this-- I'm

273
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,940
going to cut off
along the dotted line,

274
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,977
and as you can see
that dotted line, yeah

275
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,560
but won't compute
it exactly, but it's

276
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,371
a little bit bigger than 2.

277
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:26,870
All right?

278
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,828
It's a little bit longer
than that 2 there, you

279
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,090
could see that.

280
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,390
All right, so I'll call
it 2 plus, bigger than 2.

281
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,970
Now I slice off along
the dotted line,

282
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,040
and now I'm going to put
those two triangles together,

283
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,560
and I create a rectangle.

284
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,595
Two by two-- little
more than two.

285
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,095
Now the area of the
little rectangle

286
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,850
is bigger than 4, cause I got 2
times something bigger than 2,

287
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,740
and you can see here I
have the 8 left over,

288
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,020
and I have 9 plus 2 plus,
means it's a little bit bigger

289
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,120
than 11 by 8.

290
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,250
I got area bigger than 88,
add them up, get area bigger

291
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,820
than 92.

292
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,655
So I started with 90 and
I created more than 92.

293
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,441
All right, what's
the problem here?

294
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:14,940
This would be good
if I could do it.

295
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,140
I'd get some gold,
you know, bars of gold

296
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,540
and cut them up, and do the
game, and I make more gold.

297
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,340
That would be pretty
good if I could do that.

298
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,300
Because of the
conservation of area axiom?

299
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,570
Did I assume something
there that was too powerful

300
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,382
that if I manipulate the
area of rectangles like this,

301
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:35,840
that the area needs
to be the same?

302
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,630
Yeah?

303
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,170
My bigger ones aren't closed.

304
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,320
Well, let's see, I don't know.

305
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,230
Let's go back and see I
made those bigger ones.

306
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,700
All right, I got my
triangles, right?

307
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,287
I'm just chopping along the line
there, and I got 2 plus and 9.

308
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,457
Those are rectangles.

309
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,540
They look like rectangles.

310
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,541
Yeah.

311
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

312
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,050
PROFESSOR: Well it looks
bigger than 2, doesn't it?

313
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,670
Yeah, 2 pluses.

314
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,470
Well bigger than 2 is bigger
than 2, but, yeah, maybe that

315
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,329
should have been a 2 minus.

316
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,190
Would that change anything?

317
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,030
Yeah, if that had
been a 2 minus,

318
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,860
then we'd have area less than 4,
area less than 88, and then 90

319
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,420
would be less than 92.

320
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,780
That would be OK.

321
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,882
But it sure as heck looks
bigger than-- the 2 plus looks

322
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,090
bigger than the 2 doesn't it?

323
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,240
I don't know, do they
got distortion out there?

324
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,590
I guarantee you, if I
measured on my screen,

325
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,864
that 2 plus is bigger than
the length of the tube.

326
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:49,530
I guarantee you.

327
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,930
We can to take a
ruler on my screen,

328
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,510
and the 2 plus will be longer
on the ruler than the 2.

329
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,090
That I guarantee you, but
you're on the right track.

330
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,700
Yeah

331
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Good, all right,
now how did you--

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,871
but it is true, if I measured
on my screen, it's bigger.

333
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:11,370
Yeah.

334
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,970
AUDIENCE: Are the triangles,
like, drawn to scale?

335
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,502
It's like, on the SAT they
always say, not to scale,

336
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:19,350
right?

337
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,720
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

338
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,780
Yeah, they're not
drawn to scale.

339
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,850
In fact, if I go back to the
beginning, it says 9 by 10.

340
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,080
But in fact, if I measure the
nine, it's bigger than the 10.

341
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,690
All right?

342
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,706
So this is one of the big
problems of proofs by picture.

343
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,580
Because look at it,
you're not thinking which

344
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,030
is bigger, 9 or 10 up there?

345
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,199
10's bigger even though
it's not, it's shorter.

346
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,740
But when you get
down into the proof,

347
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,860
well, clearly the 2 plus
was bigger than the 2,

348
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,943
because it looks that way.

349
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,480
It is, on the paper.

350
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,980
All right?

351
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,271
In fact if you go on a
computer, you're probably right,

352
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,410
it's 1.8, not 2 plus.

353
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,940
But that's how the error
crept in and how it was drawn,

354
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,665
and then you're going
along with a proof,

355
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:04,040
and everything
else is just fine.

356
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
So the mistake is
right up front.

357
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
I drew it wrong.

358
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,320
OK.

359
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,960
And this happens,
you're doing graphs--

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,168
we'll talk about graphs here
in a couple weeks-- over

361
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,519
and over again, people do this.

362
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,560
They draw it, it looks
like this, you accept that

363
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,620
and then you're dead.

364
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,190
Everything else,
there's no hope.

365
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,080
Everybody clear what went
wrong in this picture?

366
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,630
How we got off track?

367
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,100
This is sort of a nasty one.

368
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,600
OK.

369
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,586
Now one of the nice
things about proofs

370
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:36,710
is that when there is a
bug, if you really write it

371
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,775
out step by step,
and there's a bug,

372
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:40,620
you can go back and find it.

373
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,240
And so this, I
didn't sort of really

374
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,770
write it out very
well step by step,

375
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,740
and it was harder to find.

376
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,190
Now, all right, so we
can pull the screens up.

377
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:54,460
Thanks.

378
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,915
OK, so for the rest of today
and the rest of this week,

379
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,040
we're going to talk about
a different kind of proof

380
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,600
technique, which is induction.

381
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,510
Now, induction is by far the
most powerful and commonly used

382
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,350
proof technique in
computer science.

383
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,880
If there's one thing
you should know

384
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,640
by the time you're
done with this class,

385
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,415
it's how to do a
proof by induction.

386
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,790
In fact, if there's
one thing you

387
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,280
will know by the time
we're done with this class,

388
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,020
is how to do a
proof by induction.

389
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,240
And in some sense, when we
get to grading the final, how

390
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,020
we measure ourselves
as instructors,

391
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,770
the first test is,
can you do the proof

392
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,250
by induction question,
and do a good proof there?

393
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,090
You will see it on the
midterm and the final,

394
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,410
probably in multiple instances.

395
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,960
Now just to make sure you
become intimately familiar

396
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
with induction, we're going
to do over a dozen proofs

397
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
with induction in class,
and many more in homework

398
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,610
over the next five to six weeks.

399
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,670
You'll probably be
dreaming about induction,

400
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,940
if we're successful here.

401
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,130
Soon.

402
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,984
The good news is that
induction is very easy.

403
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,150
Once you get your mind
around it, get some practice,

404
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,910
it really is not a hard thing.

405
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,600
In fact, induction is
really just an axiom.

406
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,350
So let me state it.

407
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,720
Let P(n) be a predicate.

408
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:44,940
If P(0) is true, and for all
natural numbers n, p of n

409
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,140
implies p of n plus 1 is true.

410
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,850
So here I'm saying that
this is true for all n.

411
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:00,025
OK.

412
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:11,860
Then for all n, natural
numbers, P of n is true.

413
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,220
I had another way of
saying this without the

414
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,090
for alls there, is
that if P(0) is true,

415
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:34,030
if P(0) implies P(1) is true,
if P(1) implies P(2) is true,

416
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,240
and so on, forever, then p
of n is true for all that.

417
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:48,990
So then, P(0), P(1),
P(2), forever, are true.

418
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,900
OK.

419
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,600
Now you can sort of see why
this is a reasonable axiom,

420
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,440
because if P(0) is true,
and P(0) implies P(1), then

421
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,640
by that modus ponens thing or
one of the logical deductions,

422
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,000
we know P(1) is true.

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,120
And if P(1) is true, and
P(1) implies P(2) is true,

424
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,770
then we know by
the same reasoning,

425
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,770
P(2) is true, and
so on, forever.

426
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,870
Now the reason it becomes an
axiom is that and so on forever

427
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,200
bit is part of it.

428
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,370
That's why we need
it as an axiom.

429
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,652
You could sort of view this
as a series of dominoes.

430
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:57,300
You know, I got a
domino for each n,

431
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,710
and each domino knocks over
the next in terms of truth,

432
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,230
knocking over corresponds
to the truth here.

433
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,400
And if I know P(0) is true,
that means I knock over P(0),

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,210
P(0) implies P(1) means
P(1) one goes down.

435
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,070
P(1) implies P(2) means P(2)
goes down, and so forth.

436
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,230
Pretty basic.

437
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:21,660
Raise your hand if you think you
don't have a lot of experience

438
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,745
with induction.

439
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,200
All right, yeah,
that's pretty typical.

440
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,560
About a third to a half of you.

441
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,640
So we're going to change that.

442
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,390
Let's do a simple
proof using induction.

443
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,600
So let's prove that for all
n bigger than or equal to 0,

444
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:48,140
again natural numbers, that
1, plus 2, plus 3, plus n

445
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,677
equals n times n plus 1 over 2.

446
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:55,510
This is actually a
useful thing to remember.

447
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,820
We're going to use this
all term, this identity.

448
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,740
Now the first thing,
before we prove it,

449
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,080
I want to make sure we
understand this dot,

450
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,740
dot, dot, notation.

451
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,690
Because it is the source
of a lot of errors.

452
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,180
What it means is that you need
to fill in the pattern here,

453
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,500
which is vague.

454
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,380
What it means in this case,
you fill in four, five, six all

455
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,865
the way up to n
minus 1, and then n.

456
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:22,740
That's what it means.

457
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,020
Figure out the pattern
and fill it in.

458
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,340
Pretty risky thing.

459
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,490
Now in this case,
because that's so vague,

460
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,320
there's other terminology
we use for this.

461
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,200
For example, we would
use a big sigma,

462
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,250
capital sigma i
equals 0 to n of i.

463
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,940
That means the sum of i,
where i is the integers from 0

464
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,004
to n inclusive.

465
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,170
Actually, let me put 1 here.

466
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,830
Another way to write this--
these are all equivalent ways

467
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,810
to write it-- is you
could put 1 less than

468
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,005
or equal to i, less
than or equal to n of i.

469
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,810
So you could put something i
over the range, from one to n,

470
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,000
or you can write it on
the bottom if you want.

471
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,730
So these are four
different ways of writing

472
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,106
the same thing, the sum of the
natural numbers from 1 to n.

473
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:17,730
And we'll use them
all during the term.

474
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,750
All right, now there's
some special cases

475
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,430
that make this a little
more interesting.

476
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,686
What if n equals 1?

477
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,570
I've got 1 plus 2 plus
dot, dot, dot, plus n.

478
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,490
What do you suppose it
equals if n equals 1?

479
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,910
1, because we're summing
the numbers from 1 to 1.

480
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,390
That's just 1, the number 1.

481
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,930
There is no 2.

482
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,880
And there aren't
two copies of 1.

483
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,910
So this notation
is very ambiguous.

484
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,810
You'll see a 2 here in the sum.

485
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,614
If n is 1, you'll see
a 1 here and a 1 here.

486
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:04,780
So you've got to be careful.

487
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,080
I guarantee you, you'll
make a mistake with this.

488
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,371
In fact I'm going to show
you another false proof later

489
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:11,244
where this comes into play.

490
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:13,160
What about if n is less
than or equal to zero?

491
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:16,515
What is it then?

492
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,510
Any thoughts?

493
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,680
0.

494
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,889
There are no integers to sum,
no 1, no 2, no n, because you

495
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,930
never get started because--
sorry, n is less than

496
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,550
or equal to 0-- because
you're summing from 1 to 0,

497
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,320
0 is below.

498
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,710
You never-- it doesn't
include anything.

499
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,120
So these are the conventions
to keep in mind with the edge

500
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,710
cases here.

501
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,300
All right, it's easy enough
to check that the theorem is

502
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,640
true for certain values of n.

503
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,520
For example, if n equals 4,
I've got 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4.

504
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,220
That's 10.

505
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:09,580
And 10 equals 4 times 5 over
2, plugging in the formula.

506
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,030
So for any value of n you could
check this formula is true.

507
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,930
Proving is true for all n.

508
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,820
It takes a little more effort
unless you use induction.

509
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,760
So let's do that.

510
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,870
So we'll prove the theorem.

511
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,200
Now, whenever you're using
a proof by induction,

512
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,480
first thing you do is you
write down by induction

513
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,920
so we know what
you're going to do.

514
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,980
And the next thing
you need to do

515
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,500
is figure out, what's
your predicate.

516
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,060
What's your
inductive hypothesis?

517
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,750
What's p?

518
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,870
So usually p will
be the thing you're

519
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,820
trying to prove, namely
that 1 plus 2 plus 3 up to n

520
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,460
is n times n plus 1 over 2.

521
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,390
And you state that.

522
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:06,140
You say let p of n be the
proposition, the predicate,

523
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,880
that the sum i equals 1
to n of i equals n times n

524
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,897
plus 1 over 2.

525
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,210
And once you've got
that established,

526
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,300
now we're going to go
verify that p 0 is true

527
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,030
and that p n implies p n plus 1.

528
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,510
So we always have
to write this down.

529
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,740
The next thing to do is to check
what's called the base case,

530
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,165
p zero.

531
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,300
So let's do that.

532
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,130
So we write down base case.

533
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,615
Some people call
it the basis step.

534
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,060
And we have to check
that p 0 is true.

535
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:13,650
Well, what's the sum of
i equals 1 to 0 of i?

536
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,650
0.

537
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,140
There are no terms in this sum.

538
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,020
And if I look over there,
n times n plus 1 over 2.

539
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,995
If n is 0, it equals 0.

540
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:29,720
So we're done with
the base case.

541
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,890
We've now proved
that p0 is true.

542
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,935
And the second part is
called the inductive step.

543
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,350
And here we have to show, for
n greater than or equal to 0,

544
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:53,020
we need to show that pn
implies pn plus 1 is true.

545
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,380
Now how do we show an
implication is true?

546
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,580
How do I show this is true?

547
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,810
What am I going to do to
show that's true in general?

548
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,900
Yeah?

549
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

550
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,780
PROFESSOR: Right.

551
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,230
Because an implication is true
in every case, except for true

552
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,060
implies false.

553
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,960
So if pn is false, we're done.

554
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,410
This implication is true.

555
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,530
The only case we have to
worry about is p of n is true.

556
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,600
So we assume p of n is true.

557
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,500
And now we confirm that that
means pn plus 1 is true.

558
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,960
So we write that down.

559
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Assume pn is true.

560
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,765
And you might also write down,
"for purposes of induction"

561
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:59,490
or "purposes of it verifying
the inductive hypothesis." just

562
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,152
to let us know why
you're assuming it.

563
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,610
In other words,
you're not assuming

564
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,615
pn is true for purposes
of contradiction.

565
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:07,490
You're assuming it for
purposes of induction.

566
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,370
All right, let's do that.

567
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,400
That means, in this case, i.e.

568
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:40,270
we assume 1 plus 2 plus up to n
equals n times n plus 1 over 2.

569
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:49,910
And we need to show that
the n plus 1 case is true,

570
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:58,350
and the 1 plus 2 plus n plus
1 equals n plus 1 times n

571
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,960
plus 2 over 2.

572
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,930
It's sort of weird,
and this does

573
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,830
confuse people that aren't
familiar yet with induction.

574
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,360
It looks like we just assumed
what we're trying to prove.

575
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,410
We're trying to prove
this is true for all n.

576
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,280
And we just assumed it.

577
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,360
But we're assuming it in
the context of establishing

578
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,080
this implication is true.

579
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,730
And then we apply the
induction axiom to conclude pn

580
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,480
is true for all n.

581
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:39,040
All right, well, let's
rewrite this as 1 plus 2

582
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,540
plus n plus n plus 1.

583
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,130
Because I've assumed
pn, I can rewrite this

584
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,960
as an n plus 1 over 2.

585
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,600
And now plus n plus 1 out here.

586
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,520
That equals, well, I got
n squared plus n, here,

587
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,544
over 2, plus 2 n plus 2.

588
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:22,050
And that equals n plus
one times n plus 2 over 2,

589
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,830
which is what we're
trying to show.

590
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,350
So we've completed,
now, the inductive step.

591
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,976
We have shown that for all n,
pn implies pn plus one for all n

592
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:35,100
greater than or equal to 0.

593
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,760
Any questions about that?

594
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,370
So, the proof is done.

595
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,830
We've done everything we
need to imply induction.

596
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,909
We've got p0 is true.

597
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,820
And pn implies pn plus 1 for n
bigger than or equal to zero.

598
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:05,138
Now induction helped
us prove the theorem.

599
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:07,221
Did it help us understand
why the theorem is true?

600
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,670
Do you have any feel
for why the theorem is

601
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,836
true after seeing the proof?

602
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,670
Not really.

603
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,709
I don't think--
sometimes induction

604
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,000
will give you an understanding.

605
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,900
Sometimes it won't.

606
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,950
Here you've got no understanding
of why the theorem's true,

607
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,160
which is sort of unfortunate.

608
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,979
Did induction help you figure
out the answer to the sum?

609
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,520
Namely, say you were
trying to derive

610
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,810
this answer from this sum.

611
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,730
Did induction give
you the answer?

612
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,450
No.

613
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,720
You had to know the answer,
namely this, in order

614
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,320
to prove it was true.

615
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,830
Now later we'll see examples
where induction actually

616
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,380
can give you the answer,
but often it does not.

617
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,280
Often, induction gives
you no hints, no answer,

618
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,090
just prove that it's right once
you had the clever idea that,

619
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,940
oh, maybe that's the answer.

620
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,080
You'll see that with things
like the beaver flu problem.

621
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,040
Figuring out the inductive
hypothesis or the answer,

622
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
you know, the details
of it is hard.

623
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,840
But once you do it, then
applying the induction,

624
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,410
not so hard.

625
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,660
It gives you a concrete proof.

626
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:20,350
OK, let's do another one.

627
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,850
In fact, we're just going
to spend the rest of today

628
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,110
doing induction proofs.

629
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:48,780
So for all natural numbers
n, 3 divides n cubed minus n.

630
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,740
Means than n cubed minus
n is a multiple of three.

631
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,940
For example, n is 5.

632
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:06,720
3 divides 125 minus
5, because that's 120.

633
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,191
Let's prove that.

634
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:10,565
And we're going
to use induction.

635
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,220
What do you suppose
pn's going to be?

636
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,810
What's my predicate or my
inductive hypothesis here?

637
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,480
Any thoughts?

638
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,752
Yeah?

639
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:32,684
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

640
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's you.

641
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,638
Go ahead.

642
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

643
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:36,890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

644
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,710
First thing you
always want to try

645
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,460
is you assume that is
your induction hypothesis.

646
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:50,320
So we say, let pn be 3
divides n cubed minus n.

647
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,230
What's the next thing
we do in our proof?

648
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,830
Base case.

649
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,200
Always easy to forget,
but not a good idea.

650
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,550
Base case is n equals 0.

651
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,850
And sure enough, 3
divides 0 minus 0.

652
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,753
So that's done.

653
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,210
What's the next step we do?

654
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,590
What is it?

655
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,270
Next step?

656
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,810
Inductive step.

657
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,960
And for that we're going to
need to show for n bigger

658
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:49,661
than or equal to 0, we want
to show pn implies pn plus 1

659
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,160
is true.

660
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,130
So to do that we
assume pn is true.

661
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:11,590
In other words, we assume that
3 divides n cubed minus n.

662
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,690
And we're trying to show that
3 divides n plus 1 cubed minus

663
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,270
n plus 1.

664
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:25,050
So we take a look at, we examine
n plus 1 cubed minus n plus 1.

665
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,070
And we want to show it's
a multiple of three.

666
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,540
Well, let's expand that out.

667
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:39,160
This is n cubed plus 3n
squared, plus 3n plus 1.

668
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,100
And I subtract off n plus 1.

669
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,846
So I get n cubed plus
3n squared plus 2n.

670
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,985
Is this a multiple of 3?

671
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,220
I need to show that's a multiple
of 3 and then I'd be all done.

672
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,180
Is it a multiple of 3?

673
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,950
Beats me.

674
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,965
It doesn't look like a
multiple of 3, necessarily.

675
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,200
So maybe we need to
massage it a little bit.

676
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,890
I do know that this
is a multiple of 3.

677
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,579
I can use that fact.

678
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,120
And in proofs by
induction you always

679
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,290
want to-- if you're not
making use of that fact,

680
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,390
then you're not really
making use of induction.

681
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,390
Sort of a warning sign.

682
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,220
So I want to use this
fact to prove this.

683
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,520
Well, let's get a
minus n in here.

684
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,700
This equals n cubed minus
n plus 3n squared plus--

685
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,070
if I subtracted an n I
got to add an n-- plus 3n.

686
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,700
So I've rewritten it.

687
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,160
Now is it clear?

688
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,740
Now it's clear.

689
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,390
Very simple, because
3 divide this by pn.

690
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,330
3 divides that.

691
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,810
And 3 divides that.

692
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,050
So this is a multiple
of 3, because I've

693
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:12,150
got 3 divides 3n squared, 3
divides 3n, and 3 divides n

694
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,120
cubed minus n by pn.

695
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,640
Or you could say, by the
inductive hypothesis.

696
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,680
pn is the inductive hypothesis,
another name for it.

697
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,820
So therefore, 3 divides that,
which means 3 divides this.

698
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:36,590
So that means 3 divides n
plus 1 cubed minus n plus 1.

699
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,560
And we are done with
the proof by induction.

700
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,768
Any questions about that one?

701
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,600
So the key steps in induction
are always the same.

702
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,490
You write down
"proof by induction."

703
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,570
You identify your predicate.

704
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,610
You do the base case,
usually n equals 0,

705
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,140
but it could be something else.

706
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,850
And then you do
your inductive step.

707
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,115
Now in general, you could
start your induction--

708
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:08,240
you don't have to start it
at 0, you could start it

709
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,336
at some value b, some integer b.

710
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,810
Let's take a look at that.

711
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:29,900
So you could have
for the base case,

712
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,130
you could have p of b
is true, not p of 0.

713
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,730
And then for your
induction step you

714
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:47,440
would have for all n bigger
than or equal to b, pn implies

715
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,000
pn plus 1.

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,040
And then your conclusion is
that for all n bigger than

717
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,790
or equal to b, pn is true.

718
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,630
So inductions don't
always have to start at 0.

719
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,790
You can pick where you start.

720
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,150
Just make sure that you
verify the starting point

721
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,940
and you verify the
implication for all n

722
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,772
at that starting
point and beyond.

723
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,950
All right, let's now do a
false proof using induction.

724
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:42,130
We're going to prove that all
horses are the same color.

725
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,270
So let's go through the process.

726
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:04,750
So the proof, we write
down "by induction."

727
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,320
Now we need our induction
hypothesis, the predicate.

728
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,550
So we're going to let that
be-- we can't let it be this.

729
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,950
Why can't this be our predicate?

730
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,340
All horses are the same color.

731
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,756
What's wrong with making that
be the induction hypothesis?

732
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,250
You can't plug anything into it.

733
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,900
There's no number here.

734
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,050
I've got to have a
number, n, to induct on.

735
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:37,000
So what I'm going to say is
that in any set of n horses--

736
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,180
and let's make n bigger
than or equal to 1--

737
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,920
the horses are all
the same color.

738
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,610
All right, now if I prove
this is true for all n,

739
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,280
well then all horses
are the same color.

740
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,738
Because in any set of n horses,
they're all the same color.

741
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:05,860
So all horses must
be the same color.

742
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,020
What's the next thing I do?

743
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,150
What's the next step?

744
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,870
Base case.

745
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,790
Now, what am I going to
use as my base case here?

746
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,580
One horse, OK, or n equals 1.

747
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,920
So p of 1.

748
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,650
That would say that any set
of one horses the horses

749
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,510
are all the same color.

750
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,050
That's true.

751
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:29,841
I've got one horse.

752
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:32,180
It's the same color as itself.

753
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,970
So that's easy.

754
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,310
It's true since just one horse.

755
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,100
All right, what's the
next step of the proof?

756
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,200
What's the next thing I do?

757
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,180
Inductive step.

758
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:28,060
So I'm going to assume that pn
is true to prove pn-- and show

759
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,030
pn plus 1 is true.

760
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,630
All right, so I'm
going to assume

761
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,310
that in any set of
n horses, the horses

762
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,680
are all the same color
that I start with.

763
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,050
And now I look at a
set of n plus 1 horses.

764
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,500
So we consider a set
of n plus 1 horses.

765
00:46:53,290 --> 00:47:00,060
And let's call those
horses h1, h2, hn plus 1.

766
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,400
What do I know about
horses h1 to hn?

767
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,340
They're the same color,
because pn is true.

768
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,290
There are a set of n horses.

769
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,140
By p1 they're all
the same color.

770
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:42,221
Also, what do I know but
h2, h3 and hn plus 1?

771
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,470
All the same color, because
they're a set of n horses.

772
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,170
All right.

773
00:47:51,170 --> 00:48:01,760
Well, since the
color of h1 equals

774
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:09,430
the color of those
guys, h2 to hn,

775
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,560
I know h1 is the same
color as these guys.

776
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,620
I also know that hn plus 1 is
the same color as those guys.

777
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,440
That means that h1 is the
same color as hn plus 1.

778
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,260
And all n plus 1
are the same color.

779
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,700
And that's pn plus 1.

780
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,660
That implies pn plus 1.

781
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,460
And I'm done.

782
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,720
Now a few years ago we assigned
this problem as homework.

783
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,410
And we asked students
to figure out what

784
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,860
went wrong with the problem.

785
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,740
Why doesn't this work?

786
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,230
And the responses were
a little discouraging.

787
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,950
Half the class responded,
effectively as follows,

788
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,980
this example just goes to show
that induction doesn't always

789
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,560
work.

790
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,430
A third of the
class said, I always

791
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,390
knew that you can't
trust mathematics.

792
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,140
This example just proves it.

793
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,540
That really hurt.

794
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,930
And most of the rest were
something similar to that.

795
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,180
Not exactly what we were
looking for in the homework.

796
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,030
So now we don't
leave it to homework.

797
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,110
We do it in class.

798
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,150
What's the flaw here?

799
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,248
What was it?

800
00:49:38,248 --> 00:49:39,060
AUDIENCE: P of n.

801
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,810
PROFESSOR: P of n?

802
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,873
What's wrong with p of n?

803
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:41,748
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

804
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,380
PROFESSOR: No, this
is a real assumption

805
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,280
in any set of n horses--
depends on n-- the horses are

806
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,150
all the same color.

807
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,730
That is a proposition.

808
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,340
Because it depends on
n, it's a predicate.

809
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,990
It's true or it's false.

810
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,840
Now we know it's false, because
you could get a set of a couple

811
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,670
horses with different color.

812
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,740
But it is a proposition.

813
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,640
Yeah, way back there?

814
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for
like a certain set of horses.

815
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,940
So even though it's the
same number of horses,

816
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,638
so it was the same number
as a different set of horses

817
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:23,077
it's not something you
can assume anymore.

818
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:24,410
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

819
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,450
I did gloss over something
here, because in the predicate

820
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,860
I've got "in any set."

821
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,724
So there's really a "for
all sets" sitting out here.

822
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:36,140
So I've going to
be careful that I

823
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:41,080
establish that when I'm trying
to prove pn implies pn plus 1.

824
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,520
So to establish
pn plus 1 here, I

825
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,710
assume pn which means
in any set of n horses

826
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,860
they're all the same color.

827
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,910
That I'm given.

828
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:48,840
That's pn.

829
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,500
I've got to look at any
set of n plus 1 horses.

830
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,270
So consider any set, not a set,
any set of n plus 1 horses.

831
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,060
So you pick any set you want.

832
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,870
Call them this, h1
through hn plus 1.

833
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:08,900
Well then, the first n are a set
of n horses, so I can apply pn,

834
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,290
therefore they have
the same color.

835
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:14,860
The last n horses in the
set are a set of n horses,

836
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,590
so I can imply pn.

837
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,750
So these guys all have the same
color, and I'm on my merry way

838
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,810
here.

839
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,800
So you're right, I had to
do a little bit more work,

840
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,660
but I can do that work
and I still get a proof.

841
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,114
Yeah?

842
00:51:28,114 --> 00:51:28,989
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

843
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:30,030
PROFESSOR: Good question.

844
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,950
Is there a problem
with the base case?

845
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:37,270
So my base case was
here, n equals 1.

846
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:42,060
In any set of one horse, the
horses-- let's say in the set

847
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:47,960
just to be really careful--
are all the same color.

848
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,100
No, in any set of one horses
there's only one horse,

849
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,080
so it's the same
color as itself.

850
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,096
Yeah?

851
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:54,971
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

852
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,622
PROFESSOR: n plus 1 is
not the same as n, yeah.

853
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:02,088
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

854
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:04,896
So you can't have
the same assumption

855
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,768
because it's not
a set of n horses.

856
00:52:06,768 --> 00:52:08,395
It's a set of n plus 1?

857
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,520
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

858
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,700
So you're arguing I made
a mistake here, right?

859
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,230
Well, I've got horses--
horse 2, 3, up to n plus 1.

860
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,000
How many horses are
in this set here?

861
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,802
AUDIENCE: Oh, in that set?

862
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:22,760
PROFESSOR: In this set.

863
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,400
How many horses are there?

864
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,900
AUDIENCE: N.

865
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,270
PROFESSOR: N. So I can apply p
of n to this set just the same

866
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,290
as that set, because p of
n is any set of n horses.

867
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:35,097
Well, I'm picking this one
now and applying pn to it.

868
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:36,930
And so therefore they're
all the same color.

869
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,646
Yeah?

870
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:44,060
AUDIENCE: H1, h2, dot, dot, dot.

871
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,450
PROFESSOR: Yes.

872
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,414
AUDIENCE: Because it does
work it there's two or more,

873
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:52,370
but you didn't prove it with
just one-- or from one to two.

874
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,175
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

875
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,758
Remember I told you
that dot, dot, dot

876
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:57,740
is so reasonable,
so easy to use.

877
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,540
Everybody uses it.

878
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,440
It was going to catch us up.

879
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,420
The bug is in the dot, dot, dot.

880
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:08,775
And in particular, it has to
do with the case n equal 2.

881
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,400
So there's two ways
to look at the bug,

882
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,580
dot, dot, dot, or
we didn't completely

883
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,090
do all the inductive steps.

884
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,680
So let's look at the case--
actually it's the case n

885
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,090
equals 1, here, in
this inductive step.

886
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:30,780
Did I prove p1 implies p2?

887
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,160
Let's just double check
that worked for n equals 1.

888
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,066
n equals 1.

889
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:46,030
I've got a set of two horses.

890
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,360
This becomes 2.

891
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,542
So I've got h1, h2.

892
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:52,750
Nothing in the dot, dot, dot.

893
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,310
It's just h1 and h2.

894
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:01,570
Then this becomes h1.

895
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,260
So sure enough, h1 is
the same color as itself.

896
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,170
This becomes-- what does this
become, this set of horses?

897
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,990
What is it really?

898
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,590
h2.

899
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,190
All right, so I've
got the color of h1

900
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,550
equals the color
of-- oh man, this

901
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,850
is so hard to see this bug.

902
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:23,550
I wrote down h2 dot, dot,
dot, to hn because-- take out

903
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,410
h1, what's left?

904
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,550
What's left is h2 through hn.

905
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,830
But this set is only h1.

906
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:30,830
What's really left here?

907
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,600
What is this set?

908
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,190
What is this set?

909
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,962
h2, h1?

910
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:43,450
No.

911
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,870
You see, what is the whole
set? h1, dot, dot, dot, hn.

912
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,870
What is the whole thing?

913
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,930
It's just h1.

914
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,950
pull out h1 and look
at the rest of it,

915
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,600
how many horses are here?

916
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,580
0 horses.

917
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,120
This is the empty set.

918
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,560
There are no horses
here to compare to.

919
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,220
Even though I got an h2, I got
an hn, I got a dot, dot, dot.

920
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,770
Because generally,
if n is big, this

921
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,870
has n minus 1 horses are here.

922
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,310
There's n total.

923
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,120
I got n minus 1 right here.

924
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,280
But n minus 1 is 0.

925
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,680
There are no horses here.

926
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,220
And so this bridge in the
equality totally breaks.

927
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,910
I got color of h1 equals--
there's no information here--

928
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,882
equals the color of h2.

929
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:35,590
There's no equality
here, because there's

930
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,380
no horses in this set, all
because of that dot, dot, dot.

931
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,360
Do you see where the problem
is by using the dot, dot, dot?

932
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,912
For the case n equals-- it was
true for every other case of n.

933
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:51,240
n equals 2, n equals
3, it's all true.

934
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,360
In fact, what we proved, we
proved the base case of p1

935
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,030
is true.

936
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,610
This is an argument
that p2 implies p3.

937
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,790
That is true.

938
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,680
p3 implies p4, that is true.

939
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,200
And so forth.

940
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,050
We proved for all n
bigger than or equal to 2,

941
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,780
pn implies pn plus 1.

942
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,440
That we proved.

943
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,060
What is the one missing
implication we did not prove?

944
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,410
The missing link, p1 implies p2.

945
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,080
We did not prove that.

946
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,650
Now is that true?

947
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,350
No.

948
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,330
You can find a set of two
horses are not the same color.

949
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,880
And just because every horse
is the same color as itself,

950
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,400
does not give you that.

951
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,432
That was missing in this proof.

952
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:40,890
And so we have to
be really careful

953
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,510
when you're doing these
proofs that you establish

954
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,620
the inductive step
for all n bigger

955
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,032
than or equal to the base case.

956
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,490
And then make sure,
if you're going

957
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:51,790
to use this really convenient
dot dot dot notation, that you

958
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,650
don't wind up here saying, oh
this is horses h2 through hn

959
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:00,640
when there's no horses
there, because n is 1.

960
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,370
Any questions about this?

961
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,302
Yeah?

962
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:04,177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

963
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,670
PROFESSOR: Great question.

964
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,970
All right, let's fix the proof.

965
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,500
Start with the base
case of p of 2,

966
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,250
and now I've got all this done.

967
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:19,665
So therefore, that's
another proof.

968
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:20,165
Yeah?

969
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,357
Say it again.

970
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

971
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:30,250
PROFESSOR: This
is still the same.

972
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,515
In any set of n bigger than
or equal to two horses,

973
00:57:34,515 --> 00:57:36,390
all the horses in the
set are the same color.

974
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,390
That's what he saying.

975
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,000
And he's saying, hey look,
the proof worked here.

976
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,930
The inductive step is just fine.

977
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,630
p2 does imply p3.

978
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,512
Yeah?

979
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:47,220
AUDIENCE: The base
case for 2 isn't true.

980
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,219
PROFESSOR: That's right.

981
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:51,060
The base case fails.

982
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,450
That's why you've always
got to check the base case.

983
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:55,390
Yeah?

984
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:59,851
AUDIENCE: What it does prove is
that if you find any two horse

985
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,725
and they're always going
to be the same color,

986
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:04,650
then all horses have
to be the same color.

987
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,770
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

988
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,170
That's a great point.

989
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:10,580
We have given a proof that if
you look at any pair of horses

990
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:14,380
and they're the same color, then
all horses are the same color.

991
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,620
That's true.

992
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,790
That is true.

993
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,370
Of course, there
are pairs of horses

994
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,000
that aren't the same color.

995
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,560
So the base case would fail.

996
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,170
So always check the base case.

997
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,860
You could prove some
great stuff if you

998
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,950
don't check the base case.

999
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,262
All right, any other
questions about that?

1000
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:37,148
Yeah?

1001
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:39,994
AUDIENCE: Negative
number [INAUDIBLE]?

1002
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:40,660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1003
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,806
As long as it's an integer.

1004
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:43,790
And as long as you
prove pn implies

1005
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,390
pn plus 1 starting
there all the way out.

1006
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,990
Yeah, you can start at
negative numbers if you want.

1007
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,500
Usually there's not many
cases where that comes up

1008
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,630
you want to, but you can.

1009
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,030
Nothing wrong with that.

1010
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,730
Any other questions?

1011
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:02,820
Yeah, you can see why it was
a messy homework problem.

1012
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,790
So far we've seen
examples of how induction

1013
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:09,220
is useful in proving the
hypothesis is true, but not

1014
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,920
in solving the problem, per se.

1015
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,540
Or even figuring out what
the hypothesis should be.

1016
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,400
Now in the last
example, we're going

1017
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,330
to show you how
induction can be used

1018
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:24,300
to prove there is a
solution to a problem,

1019
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,727
and also how to
find the solution.

1020
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:28,310
So it's actually going to be a
very useful, constructive thing

1021
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,390
in this case.

1022
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,390
Now this problem arose
in the construction

1023
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:35,110
of the status center, the
building we're in now.

1024
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,950
This whole building was
originally supposed to cost,

1025
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,120
completely furnished,
under $100 million.

1026
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,400
That was the goal.

1027
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,000
But the first mistake they
made was the first step,

1028
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,260
was hiring the architect.

1029
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,820
They hired Frank Gehry.

1030
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,350
I think MIT is now in a
lawsuit with Frank Gehry.

1031
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,200
So he was the architect.

1032
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,600
And costs just went nuts.

1033
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,960
As you could imagine,
all these slanted walls

1034
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,850
and crazy things happening
actually are expensive.

1035
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:05,862
And the cost quickly got
over $300 million, literally.

1036
01:00:05,862 --> 01:00:06,820
That that's parts true.

1037
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,180
Now I'm going to
fabricate a little bit.

1038
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,562
Now actually, fund raising
became a huge priority

1039
01:00:13,562 --> 01:00:15,020
once they're more
than $200 million

1040
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,670
over budget they haven't even
bought the furniture yet.

1041
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:21,000
So some pretty radical
ideas were proposed.

1042
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,390
And one of them was to build
a large 2 to the n by 2

1043
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,080
to the n courtyard
and put a statue

1044
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,990
of a wealthy, potential donor
in the center of the courtyard.

1045
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,390
So let's draw this.

1046
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,780
So the courtyard--
and of course,

1047
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,380
you know, it's computer science,
so it has to be a power of 2.

1048
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,760
So it's 2 to the
n by 2 to the n.

1049
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,060
And I've drawn here
the case n equals 2.

1050
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,960
And we've got to get the
statue of the wealthy guy

1051
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,614
in the middle.

1052
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:10,280
And I'm not supposed
to reveal his name.

1053
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,970
So we're just going
to call him Bill.

1054
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,130
So Bill's got to
go in the center.

1055
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:20,920
Now this would be fine,
except to that nothing

1056
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,870
was easy with Frank
Gehry, everything

1057
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,310
was some weird,
weird thing going on.

1058
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,860
And he insisted on
using l-shaped tiles

1059
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,660
for the courtyard.

1060
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,560
So the tiles that we're going
to use looked like this.

1061
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,260
So it's almost a two
by two, except you're

1062
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,220
missing that piece.

1063
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,930
So what you need to
figure out how to do

1064
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:47,000
is tie all this courtyard
perfectly leaving

1065
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,060
one spot for Bill
using tiles like this,

1066
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,125
these l-shaped tiles.

1067
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,650
And this is 2 by 2 here.

1068
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,150
So that's the task.

1069
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:07,030
So let's see if we can do
that for n equals 2 here.

1070
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:15,040
Let's see, we can
do a tile here.

1071
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,100
We can do a tile here.

1072
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,870
A tile here.

1073
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,520
A tile here.

1074
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,730
And a tile there.

1075
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,320
So we can.

1076
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,530
In this case we can tile
the courtyard perfectly

1077
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,440
using these L shaped
tiles, leaving one square

1078
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,819
in the Center for the statue.

1079
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,110
All right, everyone understand
what we're trying to do?

1080
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,790
The goal?

1081
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,398
Now I want to do it for n.

1082
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:50,999
So let's start proving
it by induction,

1083
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:52,790
even though we don't
know how to do it yet.

1084
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:55,123
Because we're going to see
how induction's going to help

1085
01:02:55,123 --> 01:02:58,745
us show it's possible and maybe
even show us how to do it.

1086
01:03:03,594 --> 01:03:04,635
So let's state a theorem.

1087
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:18,470
For all n there exists away
to tile a 2 to the n by 2

1088
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:28,840
to the n region, or courtyard,
with a center square missing

1089
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,480
for Bill.

1090
01:03:43,222 --> 01:03:44,680
And the proof will
be by induction.

1091
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:56,250
And our induction
hypothesis, the predicate,

1092
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,930
pn is going to be what
we're trying to prove.

1093
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,280
So this is the
induction hypothesis.

1094
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,680
Almost always when
you do the induction

1095
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,380
you want to start out with
that as your hypothesis.

1096
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,350
What's the next step?

1097
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,040
Base case.

1098
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,830
Never ever forget the
base case or you'll

1099
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:22,660
be thinking all horses
are the same color.

1100
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,350
p0.

1101
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:32,190
Well, the courtyard for n
equals 0 is just 1 square.

1102
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:35,150
And that's for Bill.

1103
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,230
So you're done.

1104
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,790
There's no tiles at
all to worry about.

1105
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,500
That's easy.

1106
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,070
So that's true.

1107
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:44,905
And then we do the
inductive step.

1108
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,965
So inductive step.

1109
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,200
For n bigger than
or equal to 0, got

1110
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,030
to remember to keep
track of that now,

1111
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:31,240
we assume pn to verify
the inductive hypothesis,

1112
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,010
or to prove pn plus 1.

1113
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,930
A lot of ways to
write this down,

1114
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,650
but you always want to say
what you're assuming and why.

1115
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:46,190
So we need to show
pn plus 1 is true.

1116
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,280
Well, so let's look at a 2 to
the n by-- 2 to the n plus 1

1117
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,600
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

1118
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,745
So let's draw it out here.

1119
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,990
2 to the n plus 1 by
2 to the n plus 1.

1120
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,400
What are we going to do to
use our inductive hypothesis?

1121
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:23,995
Yeah?

1122
01:06:23,995 --> 01:06:24,870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1123
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,170
PROFESSOR: For the-- yeah.

1124
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,920
So you're on a good
track there, for sure.

1125
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,720
But I've got to apply--
I'm not going from 1 to 2,

1126
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,336
I want to get-- I
want to use pn here.

1127
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:51,960
So I've got a 2 to the n plus 1
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

1128
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,610
How do I use pn?

1129
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,310
2 to the n by 2 to
the n courtyard.

1130
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:56,965
Yeah?

1131
01:06:56,965 --> 01:06:58,006
AUDIENCE: Oh, never mind.

1132
01:06:58,006 --> 01:06:58,964
I don't think it works.

1133
01:06:58,964 --> 01:07:01,576
I was about to say that
would be as if 2 to the n

1134
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:04,282
would divide that
into four blocks.

1135
01:07:04,282 --> 01:07:05,770
PROFESSOR: Good idea, yeah.

1136
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,830
Let's divide our courtyard
into four blocks.

1137
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,410
That's a great idea.

1138
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:13,550
And now each of these is
2 to the n by 2 to the n.

1139
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:15,210
Right?

1140
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:19,040
And I can apply the
inductive hypothesis there.

1141
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1142
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,490
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1143
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,444
Hm.

1144
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,110
Yeah, something--
yeah, it doesn't quite

1145
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:34,250
work because Bill
wants to be here.

1146
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,280
Got a little square
for Bill there.

1147
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,780
But I can't use my
inductive hypothesis to tile

1148
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:42,980
this, because there's
no square missing.

1149
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,190
In fact, even if there wasn't a
square missing, I'm in trouble.

1150
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:50,480
If I've got-- say this
is size 4 by 4 here.

1151
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,390
Can I tile a 4 by 4 region
with L shaped tiles?

1152
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:56,379
No, they're size 3.

1153
01:07:56,379 --> 01:07:57,420
3 doesn't divide into 16.

1154
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,282
Yeah?

1155
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:01,889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
There's one tile missing

1156
01:08:01,889 --> 01:08:06,067
from each of those blocks at
the corner that [INAUDIBLE].

1157
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:07,400
PROFESSOR: There's a great idea.

1158
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,030
All right, we're
making progress now.

1159
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,640
Take a corner out
of each of them.

1160
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,529
Put my l-shaped tile here.

1161
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:19,200
Now I can use the
inductive hypothesis

1162
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,319
to tile each one of these.

1163
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,643
Yeah?

1164
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:28,137
Yeah?

1165
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:31,623
AUDIENCE: Well, why can't
you put a 4 in the center

1166
01:08:31,623 --> 01:08:34,113
and then you have a
bunch of 2s on the side?

1167
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:35,689
PROFESSOR: A 4 in the center--

1168
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,784
AUDIENCE: Like a 2
by 2 in the center.

1169
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:38,700
PROFESSOR: I got that.

1170
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,790
I got Bill and the tile.

1171
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:44,147
AUDIENCE: No, but
like make it bigger.

1172
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:47,393
Not just like 4 single
tiles, but like-- so you

1173
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:49,991
have something like
that over there, right?

1174
01:08:49,991 --> 01:08:50,965
Put that in the center.

1175
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:52,913
PROFESSOR: Put that
in the center, OK.

1176
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:56,529
AUDIENCE: And the rest of them
will have like [INAUDIBLE].

1177
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:58,720
PROFESSOR: Well, the rest
of them aren't 2 by 2,

1178
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,399
because this is n.

1179
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,600
I've got to use pn here.

1180
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,869
And pn says that I can--
in a region 2 to the n by 2

1181
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:09,970
to the n with a square out
of the center, I can tile it.

1182
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,310
Am I good here so far?

1183
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:13,020
I claimed I was sort of done.

1184
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,271
Yeah?

1185
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:18,207
AUDIENCE: No, because
p of n tells us-- well,

1186
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,355
assume p of n tells us that you
can set up a 2 to the n by 2

1187
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:23,140
to the n courtyard
with a centerpiece of--

1188
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1189
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,684
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1190
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:26,350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1191
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,100
And what's the problem
for this 2 to the n

1192
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,579
by 2 to the n region?

1193
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:31,620
Bill's not in the center.

1194
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,170
He wants to be in the center.

1195
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,529
We put Bill in the corner.

1196
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:40,130
So you can't use the
inductive hypothesis here.

1197
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,899
So I went a little
too fast, here.

1198
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:44,450
This is not a proof so far.

1199
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,970
I've got a problem.

1200
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,137
Yeah?

1201
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:48,012
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1202
01:09:55,002 --> 01:09:55,710
PROFESSOR: Great.

1203
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:00,060
OK, let's then change
the inductive hypothesis.

1204
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:00,750
Good.

1205
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,620
Let's say there exists a way
to tile a 2 to the n by 2

1206
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:10,870
to the n region with a corner
square missing for Bill.

1207
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:19,459
All right, but now
I got to put-- oh,

1208
01:10:19,459 --> 01:10:20,500
but I can make this work.

1209
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:20,770
Yeah.

1210
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:20,930
Yeah.

1211
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,760
We can make something--
we can prove this now.

1212
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,218
The inductive step
is going to work

1213
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:28,320
because I'll put Bill-- say
he's in one of the four regions.

1214
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,510
Then use the l down here.

1215
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,850
Put the l here.

1216
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,900
And now I've got a
corner out of each one.

1217
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,810
And now I'm done by induction.

1218
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,315
I have proved there's a
way to tile any 2 to the n

1219
01:10:41,315 --> 01:10:46,050
by 2 to the n region with
a corner square missing.

1220
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,426
I think that proof works, Yeah?

1221
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:54,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
with Bill in the middle,

1222
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:58,266
because to prove that you can
put Bill in the corner in a 2

1223
01:10:58,266 --> 01:11:01,218
by 2 case, you can just
blow that square off.

1224
01:11:01,218 --> 01:11:05,646
[INAUDIBLE] just becomes just
another square, which is 4 by 4

1225
01:11:05,646 --> 01:11:07,770
and then you can put
him in the middle.

1226
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:08,770
PROFESSOR: That is true.

1227
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,140
So you've jumped ahead.

1228
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:14,842
We have successfully now
proved this is true for p of n.

1229
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:16,550
But Bill didn't want
to be in the corner.

1230
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,008
We're trying to
prove there's a way

1231
01:11:18,008 --> 01:11:19,844
to do it with Bill
in the center, which

1232
01:11:19,844 --> 01:11:20,760
is not what we proved.

1233
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,218
And you've come up with a way--
yeah, that might be doable.

1234
01:11:23,218 --> 01:11:25,690
First prove you can
put Bill in the corner.

1235
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:31,420
And do it in 2 to the
n by 2 to the n's.

1236
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,300
I don't know about
this, actually.

1237
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,890
I got Bill in the corner.

1238
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,010
There's some way to do it.

1239
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,630
But it might have
involved doing this.

1240
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,400
And now I can't rotate that.

1241
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,900
I don't think we have-- I don't
think that proof necessarily

1242
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,115
works.

1243
01:11:45,115 --> 01:11:54,520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] prove
that he could be here.

1244
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,490
But likewise, we could
prove that if the block just

1245
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,212
rotates you can [INAUDIBLE].

1246
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:01,170
PROFESSOR: Yes, I agree
with you and I liked it

1247
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,086
when I first heard it.

1248
01:12:02,086 --> 01:12:03,860
And you might still convince me.

1249
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,310
But all we proved is this,
there's a 2 to the n by 2

1250
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,586
to the n-- any 2 to the
n by 2 to the n region,

1251
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:12,085
we could tile it
with a corner, Bill

1252
01:12:12,085 --> 01:12:15,480
in a corner, any
corner square missing.

1253
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,910
Good, so now you want to say,
I can get Bill in the middle.

1254
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,510
And what you want
to say is OK, I

1255
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:30,549
tile this region with Bill
here, in a 2 to the n by-- maybe

1256
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:31,090
you're right.

1257
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:35,150
So then I would apply the
theorem here, with Bill here.

1258
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:35,940
Oh, Bill here.

1259
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,860
No, I think I like it now.

1260
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,546
And then I would take these out.

1261
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:45,044
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] just
takes up up three blocks.

1262
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:49,780
And that big square is just
like a zoomed out version

1263
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,660
of a little square.

1264
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,980
And since you know that little
square fits in a 2 by 2--

1265
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:04,240
like for example
in the 4 by 4 case.

1266
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,470
We proved the 2 by 2 case.

1267
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:11,235
In the 4 by 4 case
you have a big size.

1268
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:14,770
It's just like a-- you
have four squares, right?

1269
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,919
And each of those four
squares has [INAUDIBLE].

1270
01:13:18,919 --> 01:13:23,965
So you take that top right
square and you put Bill

1271
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:28,470
within the smaller
square exactly where you

1272
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,430
want him to be.

1273
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,410
And then you fill those
other-- all those empty spaces.

1274
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,342
PROFESSOR: I agree.

1275
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:35,300
You could make a proof.

1276
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,860
So in this case
you'd make a Lemma

1277
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,770
that uses induction
that says you can do it

1278
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,350
with Bill in the corner.

1279
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,080
And then as a
corollary or a theorem

1280
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,980
you'd take that and apply
it to four sub-squares.

1281
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:50,970
Put Bill in here.

1282
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,595
Take these out.

1283
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:54,011
And then now you'd have your
result of Bill in the center.

1284
01:13:54,011 --> 01:13:55,340
So that is is a way to do it.

1285
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,860
It ends up being
more complicated.

1286
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,300
There is a simpler approach.

1287
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,870
But that is a way that works.

1288
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:03,490
It is a natural thing you would
do if you had this on homework.

1289
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,980
Is you'd think of a different
thing to prove by induction,

1290
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,540
then use that as a Lemma to
get you where you wanted to go.

1291
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:14,290
There's another way to do it
without having that first step.

1292
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:16,870
And that's-- yeah?

1293
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:20,750
AUDIENCE: That courtyard
where n equals 2.

1294
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,630
Divide each cell into a 2 by 2--

1295
01:14:28,154 --> 01:14:28,820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1296
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,180
AUDIENCE: Something.

1297
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,780
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

1298
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,400
You want to do it bottoms up.

1299
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,450
You want to take it and make
that your inductive step, 2

1300
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,310
by 2's inside.

1301
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,272
I haven't thought
about that approach.

1302
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:55,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So if you could

1303
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,262
do that then you're all
set except for the 2

1304
01:14:58,262 --> 01:15:04,176
by 2 where Bill was.

1305
01:15:04,176 --> 01:15:05,800
PROFESSOR: I'm worried
about a lot of 2

1306
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,883
by 2's with a corner
missing if I do it that way.

1307
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:11,620
I'll think about that.

1308
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:17,372
There is-- let me get to
another approach here.

1309
01:15:17,372 --> 01:15:19,080
We couldn't make it
work with the center.

1310
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,580
We could make it
work with a corner.

1311
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,960
But then we had to
do more work after.

1312
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,336
One general technique
to use with induction,

1313
01:15:25,336 --> 01:15:27,460
when you're having struggling,
what's the induction

1314
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,140
hypothesis to use.

1315
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:33,040
If what you've got doesn't work,
you could pick a different one,

1316
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,180
but better to pick
a stronger one.

1317
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,643
Yeah?

1318
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:37,518
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1319
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1320
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,890
You could.

1321
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,110
And that is a good thing to do.

1322
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:50,460
Make the induction
hypothesis be much stronger.

1323
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,810
I had trouble proving
there's a way to do it

1324
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,880
with a center square missing.

1325
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,710
Turns out to be
easier to prove it

1326
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,890
where you say any
square could be missing.

1327
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,600
Seems like this should
be harder, right?

1328
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,183
We had a hard enough
time just showing

1329
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,250
this square missing was doable.

1330
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,850
But by assuming something--
by trying to prove a harder

1331
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,330
problem, assuming
something stronger in pn,

1332
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,680
it gets easier to prove.

1333
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,140
All right, now we better
check the base case, p0,

1334
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:16,900
but that's easy.

1335
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,960
There's only one
square Bill can be.

1336
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,458
But now let's look at
pn implies pn plus 1.

1337
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:26,930
So we go back to this.

1338
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:32,780
We've got a 2 to the n plus 1
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

1339
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,940
And now Bill can be anywhere.

1340
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,750
Put him here.

1341
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,420
There's Bill.

1342
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,660
Now I'm going to place my
first l-shaped tile here,

1343
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,000
in the other three regions.

1344
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,710
And now I apply
pn to each region.

1345
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:54,950
A pn says I can do it
with any square missing.

1346
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,540
So I'll pick this one out
here, this one out here,

1347
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,520
that one there, that one there.

1348
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,080
And now I'm done.

1349
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,720
That was easy.

1350
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,650
No extra steps.

1351
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,340
Now, how is it possible that it
was easier to prove something

1352
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,370
that was harder?

1353
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:13,394
Yeah?

1354
01:17:13,394 --> 01:17:15,602
AUDIENCE: First need to be
in the center [INAUDIBLE],

1355
01:17:15,602 --> 01:17:17,518
you're putting another
constraint on yourself.

1356
01:17:17,518 --> 01:17:18,840
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1357
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,470
That is true.

1358
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:22,440
But by allowing
him to be anywhere,

1359
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,420
I could have started-- I have
to-- that's a possibility.

1360
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,350
See, what I'm trying to do
here, this inductive step

1361
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:37,380
is all about proving pn
implies pn plus 1 is true.

1362
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,130
That's what I'm trying to show.

1363
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:43,840
Now, how is it useful
for me if pn is stronger?

1364
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,826
Has more?

1365
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:46,974
AUDIENCE: You grow it.

1366
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:48,515
You prove that he
can be in a corner.

1367
01:17:48,515 --> 01:17:51,090
But when you grow
it, the corner moves.

1368
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,840
But since we proved
that it can be in any,

1369
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,784
it's fine if it moves.

1370
01:17:53,784 --> 01:17:54,575
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1371
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:56,420
That's exactly right.

1372
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:00,150
ph got more
powerful, which means

1373
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,560
I get more to assume here.

1374
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,082
In the recursive problem,
Bill can be anywhere now.

1375
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:07,040
It gives me more power.

1376
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,750
I can tile any courtyard
with any square missing.

1377
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,810
This is more powerful.

1378
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,790
So this got more powerful.

1379
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,440
So did this.

1380
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,790
So what it means
is that my tool set

1381
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:20,450
is bigger with a stronger pn.

1382
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:24,240
And what I'm trying to
construct or prove got harder.

1383
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:28,430
And sometimes, if
I've got more tools,

1384
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:31,750
it becomes easier to
prove, even a harder thing.

1385
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,960
And so a general
rule with induction

1386
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,505
is if you don't first
succeed, try, try again.

1387
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:39,130
Well, the rule with induction is
if you don't succeed at first,

1388
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,310
try something harder.

1389
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,070
All right?

1390
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:45,110
And it's amazing, but it
actually works a lot of time,

1391
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,010
as it did here.

1392
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,930
If I don't assume
something strong enough,

1393
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:54,100
and pn is some little weak thing
like Bill just in the center,

1394
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,120
it's not enough to go anywhere.

1395
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,940
But if I could assume
a lot more, like Bill

1396
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:01,680
could be anywhere he pleases.

1397
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:05,870
Then I could prove
lots of things here.

1398
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,453
So it's all the art--
and you're going

1399
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:09,244
to learn this over the
next several weeks--

1400
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,650
it's all the art of what's
your induction hypothesis.

1401
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,110
Picking a good
one, life is easy.

1402
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:17,140
Picking the wrong
one, very painful,

1403
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,830
as you'll see with beaver flu.

1404
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:22,180
OK, that's it for today.
