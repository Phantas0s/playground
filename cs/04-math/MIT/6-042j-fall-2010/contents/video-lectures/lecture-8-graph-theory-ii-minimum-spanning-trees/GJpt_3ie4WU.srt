8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,300
PROFESSOR: So
welcome to this week.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,190
We're going to talk
about trees mainly.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,640
We're going to talk about
some very special ones,

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,770
spanning trees.

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,770
But before we do
this, you will go

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,690
through a whole
bunch of definitions

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,070
and look at examples to
explain how it works.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,365
So let's talk about
walks and paths.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,450
So you've already seen
a bit of graph theory.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,000
We've talked about graph
colorings and so on.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,560
But now we're going to talk
about special types of graphs,

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
and special structures
within such graphs.

20
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,510
Well, let's start with
the first definition.

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,797
How do we define a walk?

22
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:18,380
Well, a walk is
something very simple.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,250
You walk from one vertex
in the graph over an edge

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,740
to a next vertex, to a
next vertex, and so on.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,370
So how do we define this?

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:47,920
A walk is a sequence of vertices
that are connected by edges.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,910
So for example, we
may have something

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,470
that looks like a first vertex.

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,520
That we call the start.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,760
And an edge that goes
to a second vertex.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,860
We continue like
this until the end,

32
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,520
say, at vk, which we
call the end of the walk.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,370
And if you look at
this, we say this

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,900
is a walk from v0
all the way to vk.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,250
It has exactly k edges.

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:23,130
And we say that the length
is actually equal to k.

37
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,570
So this is a very basic notion.

38
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,660
And what we are
really interested in

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,770
is actually paths.

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,620
And paths are special
types of walks

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,700
in which all those
vertices are actually

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
different from one another.

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,530
But let's first give
an example of a graph

44
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,030
that you will study throughout
the whole lecture, especially

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,390
when we come to spanning trees.

46
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,070
So let's have a look
at the following graph.

47
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,840
So let this be a graph.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
And for example, we
can have a walk that

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,890
goes from this particular edge.

50
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,060
Say we call this v0.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,640
It goes over this
edge over here.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,610
Suppose I want to end over here.

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,030
Well, I can go many ways
in this particular one.

54
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,435
I can go for this edge.

55
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,670
I may go over here.

56
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,040
I may go all the way
to this part over here.

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,760
I may return if I want to.

58
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,010
And I finally, I take this
edge for example back to--

59
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,490
over this edge, I will
end in the last vertex vk.

60
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,566
So what we notice
here is that we

61
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:58,690
have a walk that actually gets
to this particular vertex,

62
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,370
and then returns to this vertex.

63
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,470
So for a few other edges, and
then goes all the way to vk.

64
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,370
So if you talk about
the path, then we really

65
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,920
want all the difference
vertices not to occur twice.

66
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,610
So let's define this
so the destination is

67
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,500
that a path is actually a walk.

68
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:33,380
Is a walk where all
edges, where all vertices,

69
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,505
vi's, are different.

70
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,490
In this particular
case-- well for example,

71
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,810
if you strip off
this part over here,

72
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,950
you will get a path from v0
to here, to here, to here.

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,450
And all these vertices
on the path on this walk

74
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,220
are different.

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,130
And therefore it is a path.

76
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,830
This also shows us something.

77
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,140
It is possible to construct
from a walk a path.

78
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,560
As you can see, we started
off with this particular walk.

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
And we just deleted,
essentially,

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,630
a part where we sort of came
back to the same vertex again.

81
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,230
And when we delete all
those kinds of parts,

82
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,530
you will end up with a path.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,660
So can we formalize this
a little bit better?

84
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,350
Then we get the next lemma.

85
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,630
I call this lemma one.

86
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,700
And let's see whether
we can prove this.

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,970
So we want to show that if
there exists a walk from, say,

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,900
a vertex u to-- well, maybe
I should not use arrows.

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,210
That's confusing--
from u to v. Then there

90
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:06,140
also exists a path from u to v.

91
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,410
So how can we prove this?

92
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,590
Do you have any ideas?

93
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,190
So what kind of proof
techniques can we use here?

94
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,396
And maybe one of the
principles that we have seen?

95
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:26,808
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but I have an idea

96
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,284
about how you could show this.

97
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:32,600
It's basically if you
visit one vertex-- let's

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,650
you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6.

99
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,132
You can walk from 1 to 6.

100
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:46,732
Then we just take out the
4, you just go 1, 2, 3, 6.

101
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:47,440
PROFESSOR: Right.

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,520
So what did we do there?

103
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
We essentially had a walk.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,250
And then we cut out
a smaller parts here

105
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,480
that recurs in a sense.

106
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,060
And we have shortened the path,
we have shortened the walk

107
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,950
to a smaller path.

108
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,720
So what we've used here
is we can sort of take out

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,850
parts of the walk just
like we did over here

110
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,440
until the walk gets shorter,
and shorter, and shorter.

111
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,420
So maybe one of the things
that we may consider

112
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,425
is a walk of shortest length.

113
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,860
And we know that
this is possible.

114
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,991
Oops, sorry about that.

115
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,470
So let's prove this.

116
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,930
So for example, suppose there
exists such a walk from u

117
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,030
to v. Then we know by
the ordering principle

118
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,900
that there exists a
walk of minimum length.

119
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,960
So that's what we're
going to use here.

120
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,000
And then we're going
to essentially go

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,580
in the same direction as
what you were talking about

122
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,510
because we're going to show
that it's not possible to delete

123
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,804
anything more.

124
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:06,470
Because otherwise,
if you could do that,

125
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,594
the walk would get shorter.

126
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:13,010
And that's not possible, because
by the well ordering principle,

127
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:22,580
we simply consider that there
exists a walk of minimal length

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,990
that we are interested in.

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,940
We will show that this
particular walk is actually

130
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,630
going to be a path.

131
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,950
So let's see how we can do this.

132
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,770
So let's do walk be equal
to-- well, it starts in v0.

133
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,450
It's equal to u.

134
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,200
There's an edge to, say, v1.

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:53,160
It goes all the way up to vk,
which is the last vertex, v.

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,410
So what are we going to prove?

137
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,140
We're going to prove that
this is actually a path.

138
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,790
And since this is a
walk of minimal length,

139
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,200
well suppose it is not a path.

140
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,980
So we are going to
use contradiction.

141
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:13,030
Well if it's not a path, then
by our definitions over here,

142
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,950
there must be two
vertices that are actually

143
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,170
the same, just like in here.

144
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,270
So we go from v0 to, say, this
particular vertex, or this one.

145
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,900
And then we come
back to this one,

146
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,220
and then all the way to vk.

147
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,950
So if it is not a
path, then two of those

148
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,150
must be equal to one another.

149
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,520
And then we are going
to use this trick.

150
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,000
We're going to
take out this part.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,070
We get the shorter walk.

152
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,660
But that contradicts that
our walk is minimal length.

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,470
So that's sort of the proof
technique that we're doing.

154
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,970
OK.

155
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,970
Let's do this.

156
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,640
So first, let's
consider a few cases.

157
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,400
If k equals 0, then
that's pretty obvious.

158
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,640
We have only a single vertex u
that is connected by a 0 length

159
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,500
path to itself.

160
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,230
So this is fine.

161
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,020
For k equals 1, we have
just a single edge.

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
And then we're done too.

163
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,830
That's a path as well.

164
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,230
So let's consider the case
where k is at least two.

165
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,874
Well, suppose it's a walk.

166
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,540
It's not a path.

167
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,695
So we are going to
assume the opposite.

168
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,340
If it's not a path,
then we concluded

169
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,330
that two of those vi's must
be equal to one another.

170
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:51,208
So there exits an i unequal to
j such that vertex vi equals vj.

171
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,800
Ah, but now we have
a walk that goes

172
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,280
from v0 all the way to, say,
vi, which is equal to vj.

173
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,480
And then we go all the way
up to vk which is equal to v.

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,420
So essentially, we have
created a shorter walk.

175
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,930
We have taken out this
little triangle over here.

176
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,920
Now this is a shorter walk.

177
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,170
And this contradicts our
assumption of minimality.

178
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,650
So that means that our
assumption over here

179
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,740
is not true.

180
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,350
So the walk is actually a path.

181
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,010
So this concludes the proof.

182
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,300
So even though this
lemma is pretty

183
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,010
straightforward in
the sense that we all

184
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,010
feel that if you have a walk,
then you can create a path,

185
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,750
if you really want to write it
down with all the principles

186
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,594
that we have been
taught, you can see

187
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:58,760
a few things appearing here.

188
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,170
So we first started with
the well ordering principle.

189
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,620
And also we used the method
of contradiction in our proof.

190
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,910
So let's set talk about
the next definition.

191
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,180
So we talked about
walks and paths.

192
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,430
Let's talk about connectivity.

193
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,430
We actually defined
two vertices, u and v

194
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,710
to be connected if
there is a path that

195
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:39,160
connects u to v. So
u and v are connected

196
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:49,680
if there is a path from u to v.

197
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,540
And now we can talk about the
graphs that are connected.

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,090
That's a very important concept.

199
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:14,480
A graph is connected if every
pair of vertices is connected.

200
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:25,490
So when every pair of vertices
in the graph are connected.

201
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,130
So an example is the particular
graph on the blackboard.

202
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,720
You can see here that
there's always a path

203
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,210
to be found from this vertex,
to this one, or to that one,

204
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,140
to this. to that,
to this, or that.

205
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,420
You can do this for
any two vertices.

206
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,130
So this is a connected graph.

207
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,500
A graph that is not
connected looks something

208
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,560
like this for example.

209
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,980
You may have a single
edge plus, say,

210
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,532
another triangle,
maybe with another edge

211
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,490
or something like that.

212
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,780
So they are disconnected
from this vertex.

213
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,690
I do not have a
graph that connects

214
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,080
to this vertex over here.

215
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
So this is about connectivity.

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:22,730
And now we can start talking
about cycles and closed walks.

217
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,686
Together, these concepts
will help us to define trees.

218
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:36,560
And then we can start
talking about this very

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,320
special concept, spanning trees.

220
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,280
So let's see how that works.

221
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,300
So cycles and closed walks.

222
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,980
We first define a closed walk.

223
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,210
And once we have done this, we
are able to get into cycles.

224
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,120
So what's a closed walk?

225
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,830
Well, it's actually a walk for
which the start and the end

226
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,830
vertex are the same.

227
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,980
So it starts and ends at
exactly the same vertex.

228
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,830
So this is all pretty
straightforward.

229
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:39,360
So we have v0 connected to,
say, v1, all the way up to vk.

230
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,650
And vk itself is equal to v0.

231
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,790
So you have a walk
that goes all the way

232
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,420
from v0 all the way back to vk.

233
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,020
For example, in this graph, you
could have walked all the way

234
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,920
back to v0.

235
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,820
You would have a closed walk.

236
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,160
So what's a cycle?

237
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,000
A cycle is a little
bit more special

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,900
in which all these
vertices over here

239
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,600
are actually different
from one another.

240
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,240
So if k is at least
three-- so the walk

241
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,940
is not just a simple edge,
or just a single vertex.

242
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:29,340
And if all v0, v1, all the way
up to vk minus 1 are different,

243
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,900
then we are saying
that we have a cycle.

244
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,060
Then it is called a cycle.

245
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,240
So these two concepts,
connectivity and cycles,

246
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,485
will help us to define trees.

247
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,630
So what are trees?

248
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,580
A simple example
is something that

249
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,570
looks like this, for example.

250
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,530
The idea is that a
tree is both connected.

251
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,630
And it has no cycles.

252
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,760
So in this case, we can see
that every vertex it's connected

253
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,310
to every other vertex.

254
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,359
But there is no cycle like
a triangle or something

255
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,220
that is connected all around.

256
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,920
So let's define this properly.

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:43,690
A definition is that a
connected and acyclic graph

258
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,720
is called a tree.

259
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,870
And within trees, we also
have something very special

260
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,520
that we call leaves.

261
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,600
And leaves are exactly those
nodes that have degree one.

262
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,740
So for example, this
node has degree one.

263
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,290
It has only this
edge connected to it.

264
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,840
So this is called a leaf.

265
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,964
This one also is a leaf
because it has just one edge

266
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,630
connected to it.

267
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,290
But this lead over
here has three edges.

268
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,140
So it has degree three.

269
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,830
This one has degree four.

270
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,850
This is the leaf again.

271
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,130
This one is a leaf,
this one, and this one.

272
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,230
So this is very
important concept.

273
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,920
We often use leaves
in our proofs.

274
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,510
And we will get to one.

275
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:45,620
So a lead is a node with
degree one in a tree.

276
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,640
OK great.

277
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,470
So now let's have
a look at trees.

278
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,410
Suppose I'm looking at
a subgraph of a tree.

279
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,947
What can we say
about a subgraph?

280
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:04,530
What kind of structure
does this have?

281
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,310
So suppose for example I want to
take some connected subgraphs.

282
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,060
So that's what I'm
actually interested in.

283
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,400
So for example, I
take this-- suppose

284
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,170
I take this connected subgraph.

285
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,150
Then what does it look like?

286
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,460
Do we see some
structure in this?

287
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,420
It's-- no?

288
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,620
AUDIENCE: It's a tree.

289
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a three.

290
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,710
So are we able to
prove this also?

291
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,060
So this lemma you
actually lose later on.

292
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:54,940
So any connected subgraph
of the tree is a tree.

293
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,440
And to prove-- well, how
can we start out a proof?

294
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,750
Any suggestions?

295
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,280
So let's have a look here.

296
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
So how may I think about this?

297
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,300
Well, I may take a
connected subgraph,

298
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,596
and I want to show--
of a tree- and I

299
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,880
want show that it is a tree.

300
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,144
A general method could
be, for example, to--

301
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:23,736
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You know, one

302
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,518
of the things, one
of the conditions

303
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:28,434
is it has to be acyclical.

304
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:31,836
So since you're not adding
nodes and you're not

305
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:35,794
starting within cycles, you
can't create a new cycle.

306
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:36,460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

307
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,840
I think you're saying
something like,

308
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,480
if I have a connected
subgraph, which

309
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,979
is like a smaller
part of the tree--

310
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,520
now suppose that
would not be a tree.

311
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,450
Say it would have a cycle.

312
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,840
Then that cycle would also be
present in the tree itself.

313
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,020
And that's not really possible
because a tree has no cycles.

314
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,440
So that's sort of indeed
how the proof goes.

315
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,550
So we essentially
use contradiction.

316
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:13,830
So let's suppose that this
connected subgraph is actually

317
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,470
not a tree.

318
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,980
So suppose it's a
connected subgraph.

319
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,040
It's not a tree.

320
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,690
Well then, in that case,
it must have a cycle,

321
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,110
because a tree is something
that is both connected

322
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,850
and has a cycle and is acyclic.

323
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,590
We have a connected subgraph,
which is not a tree.

324
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,870
So it must have a cycle.

325
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,480
So it has a cycle.

326
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,400
But now since it is a
subgraph of the bigger graph,

327
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,780
we know that the cycle must
also be in the whole graph.

328
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:07,190
So the whole graph has
this particular cycle.

329
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,620
Wait a minute.

330
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,420
The whole graph is the tree.

331
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,130
And a tree's acyclic.

332
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,280
So we get a contradiction.

333
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,610
So that means that our original
assumption that it's not a tree

334
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,890
is wrong.

335
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,580
So it is a tree.

336
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,725
So this is, again, such a
general kind of proof method

337
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,520
that we repeatedly use here.

338
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,380
So this lemma, which
we will call two,

339
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,820
we will use in the
next proof where

340
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,970
we're going to talk about the
relationship between vertices

341
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,040
and edges within trees.

342
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,450
It's a very beautiful
relationship.

343
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,150
The lemma states if you have
a tree that has n vertices,

344
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,840
then it must have
n minus 1 edges.

345
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,110
So this is a very tight
relationship here.

346
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:23,070
So a tree with n vertices
has n minus 1 edges.

347
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,860
So let's see.

348
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,930
How can we prove this one?

349
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,770
Any suggestions?

350
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,600
So what did we use at the
beginning of the course here?

351
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,040
So we have n vertices.

352
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,020
And we want to show that
it has n minus 1 edges.

353
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,670
We can use induction, right?

354
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,350
So let's use induction.

355
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,720
on n.

356
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,280
So how do we proceed
if you do this?

357
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,920
Well, we always start out
with an induction hypothesis.

358
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
So the statement here
would be something

359
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:15,380
like, well, there are n minus
1 edges in any n vertex tree.

360
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,950
And if you start with
induction, you always

361
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,580
start with the base case, right?

362
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,930
So we have the base case.

363
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,540
So how does this work?

364
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,090
So for example, we
want to consider P1.

365
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,069
So there are zero edges
in any one vertex tree.

366
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,110
Well, that's true, right?

367
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,390
If I have just one
vertex, there's no edge.

368
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,630
So this is definitely correct.

369
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,930
So that's easy.

370
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:53,900
So let's prove the other part,
which is the inductive step.

371
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:02,306
And the inductive step is--

372
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:11,270
So to do the inductive step, we
are going to always assume Pn.

373
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,530
And then we want
to prove Pn plus 1.

374
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,060
So let's do this.

375
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,390
So we have the inductive step.

376
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,780
And we always start
out the same way.

377
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:32,850
So we suppose P of n.

378
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,960
And now we want to
prove Pn plus 1.

379
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,350
So how do we do this?

380
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,910
Well, take a tree that has
n plus 1 vertices vertices.

381
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,390
And we want to show
that it has n edges.

382
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,680
So take any such tree.

383
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:56,660
So let T be a tree that
has n plus 1 vertices.

384
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,880
So how can we use the
induction hypothesis here?

385
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,360
So do you have any
ideas over here?

386
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,100
So I have a tree with
n plus 1 vertices.

387
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,960
And if I want to be able
to use this induction

388
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,740
at this induction
hypothesis, then I

389
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,125
can only apply it on trees
that have n vertices.

390
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,960
So somehow I have to
delete one vertex.

391
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
Right?

392
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,120
So what kind of vertex
can I delete in such a way

393
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,480
that we still have a tree?

394
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,550
And I need that because
this induction step can only

395
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,660
be applied to trees.

396
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:53,060
So what type of vertex can I
remove from a tree and it still

397
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,560
stays a tree?

398
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,630
So for example, if you look
at this example up here,

399
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,540
what kind of vertex
can I remove here?

400
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,326
AUDIENCE: A leaf.

401
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:04,230
PROFESSOR: Yeah, except.

402
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,594
I can remove a leaf--
for example, this one.

403
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,260
And why is that?

404
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,790
Because if there's only one
edge connected to the rest

405
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:15,420
of the tree-- so if I delete
it, I will actually keep a tree.

406
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,070
So that's how the
proof will continue.

407
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,170
So we take out one vertex.

408
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,850
So let v be a leaf of the tree.

409
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,970
And let's remove this
particular vertex.

410
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,250
So what do we get?

411
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:47,600
Well, we again have
a connected subgraph.

412
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:56,540
So this creates a
connected subgraph.

413
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,740
And we also know
that this is a tree.

414
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,640
So how can we conclude that?

415
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,060
Well, we had another
lemma somewhere

416
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,060
that's behind this blackboard.

417
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,555
It says that if you
have connected subgraph,

418
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,896
then we still have a tree.

419
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:15,040
So this is great.

420
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,380
So this is also a tree.

421
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,290
So now we can apply Pn
because we have n vertices,

422
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,140
because we deleted one.

423
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,630
So by Pn, we can conclude
that this particular subgraph

424
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,510
has n minus 1 edges.

425
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,070
You simply apply our
statement over here.

426
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,960
But we want to say something
about the original tree.

427
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,680
So how do we do this?

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,840
Well, we have to somehow
reconstruct this tree.

429
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,972
Well, we have deleted v. So
we have to reattach v again.

430
00:28:58,972 --> 00:28:59,680
So let's do this.

431
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,730
So we reattach v.
And if I do this,

432
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,310
well, let's look at
this example over here.

433
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,950
I reattach the leaf.

434
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,260
I will add one more edge.

435
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,100
So if I reattach
this particular leaf,

436
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:27,100
I will get back the
original T over here.

437
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,600
And how many edges does it have?

438
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,650
Well, it has these
n minus 1 edges

439
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,890
plus the one edge that is
needed to reattach the leaf.

440
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,420
So that's all together
exactly n edges.

441
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:54,430
So now we have shown that for
every n plus 1 vertex tree,

442
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,440
every such tree has n edges.

443
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,740
So now we're done, because
this shows P n plus 1.

444
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,105
So this is how the
lemma is proved.

445
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:08,980
And in the homework,
you actually use this.

446
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,895
So let's now talk about very
special trees, spanning trees.

447
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,760
I think this is a
very exciting topic.

448
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,060
So let's look at this
particular graph over here.

449
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,380
Let's define spanning trees.

450
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,640
So what's a spanning tree?

451
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,420
A spanning tree is a subgraph of
a graph that somehow spans all

452
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,680
the vertices within this graph.

453
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,830
So it's a tree that touches
every single vertex.

454
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,718
So for example, we may have--

455
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,690
Maybe this is not
such a bright color.

456
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,460
Maybe this one.

457
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,590
So for example, we may have
a tree that looks like this.

458
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,450
So in this particular
graph, we can

459
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,840
create a subgraph with
the thickened green edges

460
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,480
over here, which is a
tree, and also covers

461
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,972
all the different vertices
of the original graph.

462
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:35,180
This is actually pretty
amazing that you can do this,

463
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,030
you can actually create
such a kind of tree.

464
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,950
And what you want to
prove, first of all,

465
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,510
is that for every
connected graph,

466
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,870
we can construct
such a spanning tree.

467
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,660
So let's first define this.

468
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,610
And then we will
prove this theorem.

469
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,660
And then after this, we're going
to talk about weighted graphs.

470
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,772
That will lead to minimum
weight spanning trees.

471
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,230
And then it gets
really interesting

472
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,510
because you want to figure
out how we can actually

473
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,710
construct those for any graph.

474
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,930
So let's define a spanning tree.

475
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,725
A spanning tree--

476
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:40,230
And we appreciate this as
SD-- of a connected graph

477
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:51,820
is actually a subgraph
that is a tree.

478
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,900
So that's the first condition.

479
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,940
And it also covers all
the other vertices.

480
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:06,725
So it has the same
vertices as the graph.

481
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,970
And over here, we
have this example.

482
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,960
So now what you want to show
is the following theorem

483
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,940
that any connected
graph actually

484
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,810
has such a spanning tree.

485
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:43,110
So the theorem is
every connected graph

486
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,760
has a spanning tree.

487
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,090
And let's think about
a proof together.

488
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:59,020
So for example, we may
start with the idea

489
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,510
to use a contradiction.

490
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,810
Suppose there exists
a connected graph that

491
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,450
has no spanning tree.

492
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,540
So how would we go ahead?

493
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,644
So how can we prove that we
have a contradiction here?

494
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,830
So the proof that we're
going to propose here

495
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,820
is by contradiction.

496
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,620
That means that we're going
to assume the opposite.

497
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:42,040
So assume that we have
a connected graph,

498
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,014
a connected graph G.

499
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,600
That has no spanning tree.

500
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,450
So how can we use this?

501
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,300
How could this be strange?

502
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,520
Or what can we do here?

503
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,390
So one of the nice things
about trees over here is--

504
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,970
so that maybe gives us some
insight is that if we have

505
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:29,395
a tree-- well, it seems like
such a kind of spanning tree is

506
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,739
like--

507
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a solution to a
subgraph that is connected

508
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,555
with a minimum number of edges.

509
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,970
Like if I have any other type
of subgraph-- for example,

510
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,900
if it has cycles, I can always
remove an edge of course.

511
00:35:49,900 --> 00:36:00,260
So we know a subgraph of G that
touches all the different edges

512
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,980
and has a cycle
can get shortened

513
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,240
by eliminating one
edge of a cycle that's

514
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,370
within such as a subgraph.

515
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,910
So maybe we have an idea here.

516
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,340
And maybe we can use this.

517
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:23,370
So maybe we can say, let's
set consider a graph T. So

518
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:30,730
let T be a connected subgraph
of G, but with a property

519
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,570
that it has a minimum
number of edges.

520
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:41,790
So let this be a
connected subgraph of G.

521
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:47,290
And we assume that it has the
same vertices of G of course.

522
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,200
In addition, it has the smallest
number of edges possible.

523
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,720
So what do we know?

524
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,410
Well, let's look at
our assumption here.

525
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,070
We said that a connected
graph, G-- that's

526
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,140
what we consider
here-- for which

527
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,379
there is no spanning tree.

528
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,170
So what do we know?

529
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,622
We know that this
particular T over here

530
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:34,830
can definitely not be a
spanning tree, because that's

531
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,790
what we assume here.

532
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,920
Can we use this?

533
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,230
So let's think about this.

534
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,510
So if it is not a spanning
tree, then what must it have?

535
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,380
So we already know that T
is a connected subgraph of G

536
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,180
with the same vertices of
G. So the only difference

537
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,035
between a spanning tree and T
is that the spanning tree is

538
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:15,550
a tree, and T is not a tree.

539
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,870
So therefor, T
must have a cycle.

540
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,790
So we use our
assumption over here.

541
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,730
We know that T is
not a spanning tree.

542
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,060
And now we can conclude
that it must have a cycle.

543
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,530
So now we can start
thinking about this cycle.

544
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,820
And let's feel--

545
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,830
What can we do here?

546
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,445
So we constructed T
as the subgraph that

547
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:55,730
has the minimum number
of edges possible.

548
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,480
So now if you have a
cycle, the whole idea

549
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,750
is that we're going to delete
one of the edges of the cycle.

550
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,710
And if you do that, we will
be able to construct a smaller

551
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,420
subgraph T, essentially, with
a smaller number of edges.

552
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,370
And that contradicts this
particular statement over here.

553
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,900
So that's sort of
how we go ahead.

554
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,370
So if it has a cycle,
let's write it out.

555
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,195
For example, here we
have a cycle like this.

556
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:36,820
Well, let's prove that if
we remove one of the cycle,

557
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,280
that we still have a
connected subgraph.

558
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,180
So the whole graph T
is much bigger, right?

559
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,480
It has lots of
connections and so on.

560
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,470
Suppose we will remove this
particular edge over here.

561
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,100
So we remove this one.

562
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,060
Do we still have a
connected subgraph of G

563
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,060
that covers all
the vertices of G?

564
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,010
Well, of course it cover
all the vertices of G

565
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,980
because we only removed
an edge over here.

566
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,630
So that's fine.

567
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,900
All these parts are still
connected to the rest.

568
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:23,080
If you can show that it is
connected, then well we just--

569
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,380
well, we removed one edge.

570
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,210
So we actually created
this smaller graph.

571
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,510
And then we get contradiction.

572
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,800
And then we're done
with our proof.

573
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,330
So let's see whether we
can prove that if we remove

574
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,350
this particular edge
over here, that we still

575
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,110
have a connected subgraph.

576
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,055
So how can we do this?

577
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:51,382
Well, let's take-- so the
first case would be if a vertex

578
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:56,020
x is connected to y.

579
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,000
So I want to take any
pair x, y of vertices.

580
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,210
And suppose that the path
that connects x and y

581
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,030
does not contain this particular
edge e that I remove here.

582
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:18,000
So suppose this
does not contain e.

583
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,770
So I look at the graph
T. I Know T is connected.

584
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,110
So I take a pair of
vertices x and y.

585
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:31,020
I know there is a path
between x and y in T.

586
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,360
If this path does not
contain the edge e,

587
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,410
then I know that the same path
still exists in the same graph

588
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,620
where I've removed
this particular edge.

589
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,960
So that's great, right?

590
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,110
I have shown that
x and y are still

591
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:51,250
connected in the new graph
where I've removed this e.

592
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,870
So now let's look
at another case.

593
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,440
For example, x is over here.

594
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,500
And it is connected all
the way through here

595
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,770
over this particular edge all
the way to, say, y over here.

596
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,360
So this is case number two.

597
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,660
Well, are x ad y
still connected?

598
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,650
Yes they are, right?

599
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,610
Because I have removed
e from a cycle.

600
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,400
So I can still go into the
other direction of the cycle

601
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,540
and connect back towards y.

602
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,710
So what we see here is that
x can go all the way to here.

603
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,110
But it can still go
over the cycle back

604
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:45,090
to here, and then to y.

605
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,410
So we are still connected.

606
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,120
So this shows that
in both of the cases,

607
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,260
for any pair of vertices,
even after removal of e,

608
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,050
the graph T minus this
edge e is still connected.

609
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,990
So let's write this out.

610
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:20,540
So all vertices in G
are still connected

611
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:31,150
after removing e from T.

612
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,730
So now we are done.

613
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,320
So what was that again?

614
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,290
We now constructed
a smaller graph--

615
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:42,540
smaller in the sense that it has
one less edge-- that is still

616
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,890
connected, and with
the same vertices as G.

617
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,470
But I assumed that T
was already the smallest

618
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,450
such graph, such subgraph.

619
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,370
So we have a contradiction.

620
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,190
So what does this mean?

621
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,870
This means that our original
assumption that we have over

622
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:03,170
here cannot be true because
we started off with this

623
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,530
assumption.

624
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,460
Because of this, we could
start to construct this.

625
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,705
And then you could derive
this whole argumentation.

626
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:13,330
And in the end, we
get a contradiction.

627
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,750
So our original
assumption is wrong.

628
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,040
So actually, this
is not possible.

629
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,760
There does not exist a connected
graph G that has no ST.

630
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,120
So the theorem is true.

631
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,590
So this is an important theorem.

632
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,416
So now we can start talking
about weighted minimum spanning

633
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:34,915
trees.

634
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:48,020
So let's use this picture over
here and assign some weights

635
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,260
to this graph.

636
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:08,800
So for example, we have 1,
2, 2, 3, 3, 3, a 1 over here,

637
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,130
another 1, 1, 4, and 7.

638
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,950
And let's construct
a spanning tree.

639
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,110
So let me give an
example over here.

640
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,980
Actually, this is an example
that we have right her

641
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,580
in the thick lines in green.

642
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,430
So what is the weight
of the spanning tree

643
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,580
that we have here?

644
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,920
So we simply add the
weights of all the edges.

645
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,020
So we have 7, 3.

646
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,960
That makes 10.

647
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,800
11, 14, another
2, 16, 17, 18, 19.

648
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:53,650
So the weight of this
particular spanning tree is 19.

649
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,700
So now the problem
is-- and that's

650
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,970
the rest of the
lecture-- how can you

651
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,790
construct a minimum
weight spanning

652
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:05,870
tree, one that has the
minimum weight possible?

653
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,380
So we see another example.

654
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,280
So could I swap
some edges around

655
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,560
or something like that such
that I can get a lesser weight?

656
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,940
So for example, over here,
I have-- for example,

657
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:27,290
this node over here is connected
by an edge that has weight 3.

658
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,590
But I could also
have connected it

659
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,530
to this particular one over
here, which is only weight 1.

660
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:39,220
If I do this, I actually improve
the spanning tree construction.

661
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,035
So I will get something
that looks like--

662
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,095
Let's see-- that
looks like this.

663
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,590
And now we replaced 3 by 1.

664
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,260
So it gets 17.

665
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,060
So can we do anything
less than this?

666
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,580
That's maybe-- it's
still a tree, right?

667
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,850
Because there's no cycle.

668
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:14,300
Here we have this, this,
this, this part over here.

669
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,230
If you want to have
connected subgraph,

670
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,040
I always need the 7 in here.

671
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,170
Well, it seems like you
cannot really replace anything

672
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,020
by something cheaper.

673
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:34,467
Like any edge in here seems
to be pretty necessary.

674
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:36,300
Of course, what I could
do is I could create

675
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,000
other minimum spanning trees.

676
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,060
So actually it turns out that
17 is the minimum weight.

677
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,640
For example, I could,
instead of this edge,

678
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,270
I could use this edge.

679
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,930
That's another solution.

680
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,070
Or instead of this edge,
I could use this edge.

681
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,080
So how do we construct such a
minimum weight spanning tree?

682
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,330
Can we somehow find an
algorithm that creates this?

683
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,220
And that's the big
problem of today.

684
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,860
So let me write out
one spanning tree

685
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,890
that I will use for
the rest of this class.

686
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:23,604
And maybe I will use a
little bit different color.

687
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,720
Let's use red over here.

688
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:40,850
I hope this is visible.

689
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,828
So we have red, this
one, and this one,

690
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:54,300
and this one, and this
one, and this one.

691
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,480
That's going to
be-- this is going

692
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,440
to be the spanning tree
that I'm going to look at.

693
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,730
This is also weight 17.

694
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,780
So let's first define what a
minimum weight spanning tree

695
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,180
is, just to be very precise.

696
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,610
And then let's
have an algorithm.

697
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:22,790
Maybe you have already ideas
of how this could be done.

698
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,610
It turns out actually
that if you just

699
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,890
start with a greedy
approach, you just

700
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:31,420
start to add sort of through
the edges of minimum weight,

701
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,630
that you can still add
without creating any cycles.

702
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,300
You will get an
algorithm that is

703
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,030
going to do the trick for you.

704
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,830
So that's kind of surprising.

705
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,555
So let's talk about
the definition.

706
00:49:50,560 --> 00:50:01,830
So the minimum spanning tree
of an edge weighted graph

707
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:06,030
is defined as--

708
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:17,270
It's defined as the
spanning tree of G such

709
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:31,850
that it has the smallest
possible sum of edge weights.

710
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,810
Well the algorithm
that I'm thinking about

711
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,530
here is very straightforward.

712
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,610
Actually I'll use
this blackboard

713
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,160
because this algorithm
will be the focus

714
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,930
of the rest of the lecture.

715
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,870
So what's the algorithm?

716
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:20,430
We actually grow a
subgraph step by step.

717
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:35,360
So one edge at a time
such that at each step

718
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:55,850
we want to add the
minimum weight edge that

719
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,900
keeps the subgraph acyclic.

720
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,940
So this is our algorithm.

721
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,010
Let's have a look how this
works in this particular graph

722
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:18,733
over here.

723
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,530
So suppose I would
start off with-- well,

724
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:31,080
if I start with this algorithm.

725
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,340
I take, say, any
minimum weight edge.

726
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,120
Say I take this particular one.

727
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,160
So this could be my
first edge that I choose.

728
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,980
Then I may want to choose
another minimum weight

729
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,199
edge such that I do
not create a cycle.

730
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,490
Well, which one could I choose?

731
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,770
I could choose this one.

732
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,494
I could also choose this one.

733
00:52:52,494 --> 00:52:54,160
With this one, I could
choose this part.

734
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,826
With this one, I could
choose that part.

735
00:52:55,826 --> 00:52:57,430
I could also choose this one.

736
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,780
So let's choose
this one actually.

737
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,540
This would be our second
step and our second edge

738
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,490
that we select in our algorithm.

739
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,130
There are two disjoint edges.

740
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,820
So there's definitely no graph.

741
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,810
Well, maybe now
our third step, I

742
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:21,390
can choose one of these edges,
which also has just weight

743
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,030
1, which is minimum weight.

744
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,323
So this could be my
third possibility.

745
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,570
Then what's the
fourth possibility?

746
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:35,890
Well, I have to choose
one of those actually.

747
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:40,350
I cannot choose
this weight 1 edge?

748
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,850
Why not?

749
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,400
Because that would
create a cycle.

750
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,520
So I'm not allowed to
choose this one anymore.

751
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,340
So I choose one of these two.

752
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,860
So for example, I choose
this one over here.

753
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,410
This is the fourth edge that
I add to the whole picture.

754
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,200
So note that in the meantime.

755
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,370
I have two disconnected
components.

756
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:07,300
One other here, which is this
arc, and another arc over here.

757
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,860
So which edge do I attach
now in the algorithm?

758
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,050
Well, I can still add
this minimum weight edge

759
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:20,140
over here of weight two, because
it does not create any cycle.

760
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,860
So this would be
the fifth wonder

761
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,500
that I add to the whole picture.

762
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,750
Well, now I can choose
either one of those.

763
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,310
So for example, this
would be my sixth step.

764
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,420
And then finally, I can
choose none of these

765
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,410
because those would
create cycles.

766
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,350
But I can choose this one.

767
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,990
So this is going to be
the seventh one that I

768
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:47,270
add to the whole graph
that I construct here

769
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,060
and grow in this algorithm.

770
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,510
It turns out that this algorithm
actually creates for you

771
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,360
a minimum spanning tree.

772
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,700
And the proof is
much more complex

773
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,120
than what you have seen before.

774
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,970
So that's what we're
going to do right now.

775
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,050
So when we think
about this algorithm,

776
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,220
then somehow I want to guarantee
that at every single step,

777
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:14,090
I will be able to grow into
a minimum spanning tree.

778
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:18,090
And that's the basic
intuition that we have.

779
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,520
And that's the lemma that
we want to prove first.

780
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,227
So formalizing, we
get the following.

781
00:55:29,227 --> 00:55:30,935
We want to prove the
following statement.

782
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:46,870
So the lemma that will help us
is let S be the set of edges

783
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:53,100
that I have been selecting
up to now in the algorithm.

784
00:55:53,100 --> 00:56:00,175
So let S consist, for
example, of the first m edges.

785
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:17,760
What we want to show
is that we can still

786
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,960
extend this set of edges
into a minimum spanning tree.

787
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,190
We can still grow
within the algorithm

788
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:24,950
into a minimum spanning tree.

789
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,280
That is what you want to show.

790
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:34,300
So we want to show that their
exists a minimum spanning tree

791
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:41,942
T that has the vertex
set V and an edge set E.

792
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,220
So this is the minimum
spanning tree for the graph G

793
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:57,950
such that S is actually
a subset of the edges

794
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,200
in this minimum spanning tree.

795
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,780
So this is a nice
mathematical formulation

796
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:08,836
that really precisely
states that we can still

797
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,710
keep on growing into a
minimum spanning tree.

798
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,560
So how would this lemma help
us in proving the theorem

799
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,980
that we want to show?

800
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,110
Actually, where is the theorem?

801
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,080
I did not write down
the theorem so far.

802
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,180
I can put this over here.

803
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,910
So the theorem
that's want to show

804
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:43,990
is that for any connected
weighted graph G,

805
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,180
the algorithm creates a
minimum spanning tree.

806
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:59,960
The algorithm produces
a minimum spanning tree.

807
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,580
So how can we prove his theorem?

808
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,840
Suppose we know that
this lemma is true,

809
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,050
which we will prove later.

810
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,010
Then how do we know
that this theorem holds?

811
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,630
Actually, I'm wiping out this
particular theorem over here.

812
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,530
We will use this in a moment.

813
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,990
So we know that every connected
graph has a spanning tree.

814
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,740
We already know that.

815
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,880
But now we want to
show that we can even

816
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,480
construct a minimum spanning
tree for a weighted graph.

817
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,140
So how are we going ahead?

818
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:45,820
The proof of the
theorem is as follows.

819
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,940
I will suppose that
the number of edges--

820
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,320
the number of vertices--
is actually equal to n.

821
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,750
And if we want to show that we
get to a minimum spanning tree,

822
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,820
we want to first of all
show that the algorithm

823
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,840
is able to choose at least
n minus 1 edges, right?

824
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,100
Because a tree has
n minus 1 edges.

825
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,395
We have shown this before.

826
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,030
The algorithm should
not get stuck.

827
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,280
So let's first prove that.

828
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,160
So suppose I have chosen
less than n minus 1 edges.

829
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:31,920
So suppose we have less
than n minus 1 edges picked.

830
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,220
Well then what do we know?

831
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:44,460
Well, there exists as
edge in E minus S--

832
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,510
well, let me first
write it out--

833
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:58,440
that can be added
without creating a cycle.

834
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,760
So why is this?

835
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,220
Well, I know that
E is the edge set

836
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,760
of my minimum spanning tree.

837
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:18,390
I know that S is a part of--
is a subset of all the edges.

838
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,490
I know that a minimum
spanning tree is a tree.

839
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,570
It's a tree on n vertices.

840
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:29,870
We know that's a tree on n
vertices has n minus 1 edges.

841
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:35,070
I know that less than n minus 1
edges have been chosen so far.

842
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:40,720
So that means that S has
less than n minus 1 edges.

843
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,650
E has successfully
n minus 1 edges.

844
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,915
So there's at least one
edge that is contained,

845
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:52,345
that it is an element
in E, but not in S.

846
01:00:52,345 --> 01:00:55,610
And for that
particular edge-- well,

847
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,390
since it's part of
this tree, together

848
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:05,340
with S, which is also part of
all the edges within the tree--

849
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,770
well, we know that that
edge, for that reason,

850
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,990
will not create a cycle.

851
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:14,830
Because otherwise, the
original would have a cycle.

852
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,340
So we know that the
algorithm can always

853
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:25,300
select an edge such that's
no cycle is created.

854
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,960
And that means that we can
keep on going in the algorithm

855
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,410
until at least n minus
1 edges are selected.

856
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:36,695
So what happens if we
have n minus 1 edges?

857
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:49,960
So once n minus 1
edges have been chosen,

858
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,500
well, then S has
exactly n minus 1 edges.

859
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,450
E has exactly n minus 1
edges, because it's a tree.

860
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,930
They are subsets of one another.

861
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,330
So they must be
equal to one another.

862
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,160
So essentially what
we have here is

863
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:10,040
that S exactly defines
the minimum spanning tree

864
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,730
that we are looking for.

865
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:15,880
So the algorithm
at the very end,

866
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,010
when it has chosen
n minus 1 edges,

867
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,540
produces a minimum
spanning tree.

868
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:34,130
So we know that S defines
the edges of a minimum weight

869
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,970
spanning tree.

870
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,610
So if this lemma
really holds true,

871
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,226
then this theorem can be shown.

872
01:02:41,226 --> 01:02:42,850
So now let's have a
look at this lemma.

873
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,830
And we're going to use
that picture over there

874
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,610
to see how we can prove this.

875
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,610
So this is a little bit tricky.

876
01:02:51,610 --> 01:03:00,340
And the way to go about this
is actually to use induction.

877
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,640
So let's check see whether
we can do this together.

878
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,740
So the proof of the
lemma is as follows.

879
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,940
We want to use induction.

880
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,160
On what do you think we
are going to induct here?

881
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,560
Well, we want to prove
this particular lemma,

882
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,490
and we have this
particular variable m.

883
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,790
So that seems to be a
good methods to continue.

884
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,840
So we'll use induction on m.

885
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:47,030
Let's state the
induction hypothesis.

886
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,000
Well, it's exactly the
same as in the lemma.

887
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,780
So we say for all
G and for all sets

888
01:03:54,780 --> 01:04:12,730
S that consists of the
first m selected edges,

889
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:22,120
there exists a minimum
spanning tree of G such

890
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:28,780
that S is a subset of E.

891
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,020
So this is how
induction hypothesis.

892
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:34,720
And as always, we start
with the base case.

893
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,980
And the base case is
going to be pretty

894
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,900
straightforward in
this particular case.

895
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,690
We have to do a little
bit of work for it.

896
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,660
So let's see how that works.

897
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,620
So the base case is m equals 0.

898
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:54,880
So let's reread this statement
where m is equal to 0.

899
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:03,780
Well, if we have zero selected
edges, then S is the empty set.

900
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,900
So I have to prove
that for all G,

901
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,240
there exists a minimum
spanning tree such

902
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,010
that the empty set is a subset
of E. Well, the empty set is

903
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,691
always a subset of E, right?

904
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:15,565
So that's no problem.

905
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,570
So what I need to proof
is that for all G,

906
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,780
there exists a minimum
spanning tree of G.

907
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,610
And this is where our
previous theorem comes in,

908
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:32,010
because we showed
that for all graphs G,

909
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,450
there exists a spanning tree.

910
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,950
And if there exists
a spanning tree,

911
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,540
there exists a minimum
weight spanning tree.

912
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:39,660
So that's the base case.

913
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:46,380
So m equals 0 implies that
S is equal to the empty set.

914
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,530
So that means that
S is definitely

915
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:58,420
a subset for any set of edges of
a minimum weight spanning tree.

916
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:07,030
And now we're going to use our
theorem to show that there also

917
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,570
exists a minimum spanning tree.

918
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,950
So this in itself is not
yet sufficient, right?

919
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:13,970
You see that.

920
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,450
I know that if S
is the empty set,

921
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,120
then I know that
this always holds.

922
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,230
But the statement is
a little bit bigger.

923
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,989
For all G, I still
need to prove there

924
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:25,280
exists a minimum spanning tree.

925
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,950
And that's what our
previous theorem told us.

926
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,800
So we'll now write
that part out.

927
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,090
So we have to base case.

928
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,130
Let's see.

929
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:49,020
I think I will go and
prove this over here.

930
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,106
So let's look at the--

931
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,850
That's the inductive step.

932
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:59,750
And then hopefully we can play
a little bit with this picture

933
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,916
up here to get some insight.

934
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:09,050
So how do we do this?

935
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,480
Well, with an inductive
step, we start as usual.

936
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:23,765
We assume that P of m holds.

937
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:27,880
Now how do we go ahead?

938
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:34,160
So I want to prove Pm plus
1, which is stated over here.

939
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,150
So I want to consider
the set S that

940
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:40,960
consists of the first n
plus 1 selected edges.

941
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,140
So well, essentially
what I'm interested in

942
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,940
is what happens in
the n plus 1 step.

943
01:07:49,940 --> 01:08:03,484
So let E denote the edge that
I added in the m plus 1 step.

944
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,319
And let S be the first
m selected edges.

945
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,500
And we know that we can
apply p of m for S, right?

946
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,960
Because we assume this
is our inductive step.

947
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,140
So we can apply
something for S. We

948
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,554
would like to show Pm plus 1.

949
01:08:27,554 --> 01:08:28,970
So we would like
to show something

950
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,710
for the union of those two.

951
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,870
So let me repeat that.

952
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:40,800
Let S denote the first
m selected edges.

953
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:54,430
So by our induction hypothesis,
we can-- well, let's apply it.

954
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,810
We know that there
exists a minimum spanning

955
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:01,700
tree such that S is a
subset of the edges.

956
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:06,050
So let's just pick one
such minimum spanning tree.

957
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:11,490
So let T star be such a
minimum spanning tree.

958
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,490
It has edges E star.

959
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:27,640
And we know that S is
actually a subset of E star.

960
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:37,507
Let's look at the
very first case.

961
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,840
So what are the kind of cases
that we are interested in?

962
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,700
So let's think again.

963
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,990
What do we need to prove?

964
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:45,420
We need to prove Pn plus 1.

965
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,670
So we need to prove something
about the union of S and E.

966
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:52,729
We want to show that there is
a minimum spanning tree such

967
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:56,220
that the edge set of this
minimum spanning tree

968
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:01,190
contains both S and also E.

969
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:05,100
So what kind of cases
can we handle here?

970
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,590
Well, what will be a
really good first case?

971
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,260
The first case could be
that E is actually already

972
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,790
part of E star.

973
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:20,980
Well, if that's true, then
of course, S together with E

974
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,700
is also a subset of E star.

975
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:32,450
And that means that we are
done, in this particular case.

976
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,570
And why is this?

977
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:38,220
Because this is an example of
a minimum spanning tree that

978
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,025
contains both S and E.
So it contains the n

979
01:10:41,025 --> 01:10:43,430
plus 1 first selected edges.

980
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,830
And so this is Pn plus 1.

981
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,890
Now the next case is
the difficult part.

982
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:59,400
OK, let's wipe
out-- actually, we

983
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,150
do not really need the proof
of the theorem anymore.

984
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,930
So let's take this
off the blackboard.

985
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:18,910
So the way to do this
is to sort of see

986
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:26,040
how we can use the tree, T
star, and somehow transform it

987
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,680
into another tree for
this particular case

988
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,565
where we assume that
E is not in E star.

989
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:44,070
So let's have a look
at that graph up there.

990
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,730
Let me rewrite it a little bit.

991
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,020
And let's look at what
happens in the algorithm

992
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,200
after two steps.

993
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,980
So I will redraw the graph.

994
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:03,920
So we have, say, these edges.

995
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:19,370
This one-- let me see.

996
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:24,100
I want to use some different
colors to make this as clear

997
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,630
as possible.

998
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,623
We have this one.

999
01:12:28,623 --> 01:12:30,516
We have this one.

1000
01:12:30,516 --> 01:12:33,170
We have this one.

1001
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:35,140
And we also have
this one actually.

1002
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,440
Sorry.

1003
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:41,740
All right, so let's define
the different edges.

1004
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,290
The straight ones
from the set S.

1005
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,990
So after two steps over there,
we have selected this edge

1006
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,630
first, and then this
edge was the second edge

1007
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,150
that we selected
in our algorithm.

1008
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:59,860
So these two together
form the set S.

1009
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:02,100
So what is T star?

1010
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,270
T star could be, for
example, the spanning tree

1011
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:14,155
that contains both these
edges plus the dotted ones.

1012
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,300
So let's have a look here.

1013
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,390
This is indeed a tree, right?

1014
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:26,580
And if we look into
this picture over here,

1015
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:30,710
you can see that the weight
of this particular tree is 17.

1016
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,180
It's also a minimum
weight spanning tree.

1017
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,240
What is G?

1018
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,500
G is the complete graph and
contains not only these two

1019
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,245
types of edges, but also these
sort of more orange colored

1020
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:46,744
ones.

1021
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:54,490
So this is so the
situation that we are in.

1022
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:58,870
Now in our algorithm,
we want to choose

1023
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,350
this particular third edge.

1024
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:09,140
So this is going to be our
e, this particular edge.

1025
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,320
And as you can see, e
is not part of T star.

1026
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,190
It's not one of those
two kinds of edges.

1027
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:20,230
It's actually one
of the orange edges.

1028
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,400
So what can we do here?

1029
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,640
Well, the idea is that we
want to recreate like a you

1030
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:35,530
tree in which we somehow
exchange e-- exchange one

1031
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:39,330
of the edges in T
star with e, and still

1032
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:42,740
sort of maintaining the
minimum spanning tree property.

1033
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,970
So how can you prove this?

1034
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:57,190
The way to do this
is to figure out

1035
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:00,610
what the algorithm
teaches us about e,

1036
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:04,771
and also what the tree
property tells us.

1037
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,410
So let's combine
all our knowledge.

1038
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:13,470
So first of all, we
know that the algorithm,

1039
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:18,470
from its definition,
implies that as together

1040
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:24,370
with e, actually has no cycle.

1041
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:28,750
That's how we select
the n plus 1 edge.

1042
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:32,710
There's no-- all
selected edged together

1043
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,020
should not contain a cycle.

1044
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,040
That's the definition
of the algorithm.

1045
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,430
We know that T star is a tree.

1046
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:45,750
And this implies that if
you look at the graph that

1047
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,710
has the edges, has the
vertices V together

1048
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:56,250
with E star with edge e, then
this must contain a cycle.

1049
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,626
Now this property I will
not prove right now,

1050
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:04,000
but it is pretty
straightforward.

1051
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,840
It's a one line proof
actually in the book.

1052
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,080
So you can look it up.

1053
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,050
So it simply states that
if you have a tree, if you

1054
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:15,500
add another edge, an edge that
is not contained in E star,

1055
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,110
then we will create a cycle.

1056
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,780
So now we can combine these
two statements together

1057
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:30,500
and conclude that, well,
if S with e has no cycle,

1058
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:36,940
but E star with e has a cycle,
and S is contained in E star,

1059
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,180
well there's only
one possibility.

1060
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:52,420
And that is that this cycle
must have an edge, e prime, that

1061
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:56,210
is in E star minus S.

1062
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,630
Because if it would
not have such an edge,

1063
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:08,440
then all the edges of the cycle
must be located in S-- in S

1064
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,432
together with E. But S
together with E has no cycle.

1065
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:12,390
So that's not possible.

1066
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,460
So this cycle must
have and edge e

1067
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,850
prime that is outside
S, but still in E star.

1068
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:22,000
So we can find one over here.

1069
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,800
e prime can be this
particular edge.

1070
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,820
So e prime is in E star.

1071
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:33,980
But it is not already
selected in S.

1072
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,085
So now we are going
to do a trick.

1073
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:43,560
The idea is to
swap e and e prime.

1074
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,580
So that's the main idea.

1075
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:51,620
So let's first write down what
we know about the weight of e

1076
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,770
prime and e.

1077
01:17:53,770 --> 01:18:04,370
So since the algorithm,
well, could have selected e

1078
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:07,300
or e prime-- it did
select e, right?

1079
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,670
But it could have
also selected e prime,

1080
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:15,150
because e prime does not
create a cycle with S.

1081
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:18,760
That's what we have seen here.

1082
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:27,920
So this really implies
therefore that the weight of e

1083
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:35,520
is at most the
weight of e prime.

1084
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,210
So why is this?

1085
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,540
Because the algorithm always
chooses the minimum weight.

1086
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:43,515
And it can choose between e
or e prime, but it chose e.

1087
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:47,320
So the weight of e must be less
than the weight of e prime.

1088
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,620
So that's what we know also.

1089
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:54,030
So now let's swap
e and e prime in T.

1090
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,900
And then we're almost
done with this proof,

1091
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:02,295
because that will be the tree
of which we will prove that it

1092
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:04,386
is a minimum spanning tree.

1093
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:22,510
So the key idea is to swap e and
e prime in T. How do we do it?

1094
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,390
Well, let T double
star be equal to V

1095
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:32,080
with the edge set
E double star where

1096
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:38,530
E double star is really equal
to, well, the original set E

1097
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,260
star.

1098
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:43,000
But we take out of this e prime.

1099
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,330
So this one is taken out of
the minimum spanning tree.

1100
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:48,614
And we add e in here.

1101
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,440
Now we want to prove
that this particular T

1102
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,100
double star is a minimum
spanning tree that

1103
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,810
fits our lemma.

1104
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:03,180
So what do we know?

1105
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,366
We know that T double
star is acyclic.

1106
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,030
And why is this?

1107
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:25,500
Well, we actually removed e
prime from the only cycle-- so

1108
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:33,000
look up here also-- the
only cycle in E star

1109
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,720
together with e.

1110
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,110
So it's acyclic.

1111
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,130
T double star is also connected.

1112
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,620
And why is that?

1113
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:52,440
Well, since e prime is
removed-- but it was on a cycle.

1114
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,988
So it remains connected.

1115
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:04,300
And finally, we also know
that T double star actually

1116
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:15,530
contains all the vertices in
G. So all these three together

1117
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:22,830
with prove that T double
star is a spanning tree of G,

1118
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,700
because it's acyclic, connected,
contains all the vertices.

1119
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,780
Is it a minimum
weight spanning tree?

1120
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,840
Now we are really almost done,
because-- let me write it out

1121
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,980
here.

1122
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:42,980
We know that the
weight of T double star

1123
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:48,270
is at most the weight of T star.

1124
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,210
Why is this?

1125
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:53,570
Well, we showed just
now that the weight of e

1126
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,350
is at most the
weight of e prime.

1127
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,360
So we have exchanged
e and e prime.

1128
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,750
So that means that the
weight of T double star

1129
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,110
is at most that of
the weight of T star.

1130
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:12,750
We also know that T star
is a minimum spanning tree.

1131
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:17,600
So if you combine
these two together,

1132
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,290
then we know that the weight of
T double star cannot get less

1133
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:22,010
than the minimum
weight possibility.

1134
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:25,080
So it also has a minimum weight.

1135
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,940
So T double star is a
minimum spanning tree.

1136
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:33,250
So now we're done
because in this case,

1137
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,720
we have constructed
a T double star such

1138
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:44,720
that S together with E is
a subset of E double star.

1139
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,630
And that means that we have
shown that our induction

1140
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,110
step is true.

1141
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,800
We have shown that
Pn plus 1 holds.

1142
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,040
So now we finally have figured
out that the lemma is true.

1143
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:05,080
And now we showed already how
to use the lemma in our proof

1144
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,570
for this particular theorem.

1145
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:11,030
So this is the end
of this lecture.

1146
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:14,620
And tomorrow, you will actually
go again over this proof

1147
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,830
because it's rather complex.

1148
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:19,740
And then hopefully you
really get into all

1149
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,110
the different proof techniques.

1150
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,610
OK.

1151
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,510
Thank you.
