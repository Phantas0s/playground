8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,120
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,560
Last time we looked at a
variety of ways to analyze sums

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,900
and to find closed-form
expressions for the sums.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,440
And today we're going to
use those methods to solve

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
a variety of famous problems,
one of them involving center

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,370
of mass and stacking blocks.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,810
We saw a version
of that yesterday

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,000
in recitation, where you solved
the problem of figuring out

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,150
how many L's you need to make
something like this balance

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,870
perfectly.

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,250
Now in this case I didn't
actually get an integer number

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,750
of L's-- which is possible--
because I didn't quite get it

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,230
stacked right at the bottom.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,150
So I got 10 and 1/2 L's here.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,660
There's an extra vertical here.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,990
Now in theory there are two
integer ways of doing it.

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,430
And you proved that
yesterday in recitation.

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,060
So in theory, 10
and 11 should work,

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,170
but in practice the
blocks aren't perfect.

27
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,000
I didn't get them
perfectly lined up.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
And so 10 wouldn't quite
work, and 11 tended

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,530
to pitch it the other way.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,890
And of course in theory, as
long as the center of mass

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,080
is just anywhere over this
block, it's going to be stable.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,550
In practice there's air moving
around, and bouncing and stuff.

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,900
And so if you're close to
the edge, it's going over.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,420
OK.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,503
So now if you want to build
one of these yourself,

36
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,110
it's not hard to do.

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,864
You just start with an
extra block here, all right,

38
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:49,780
and then you build up.

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,446
And that's easy.

40
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,912
And then you notice
when it's about right.

41
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,870
And you can just start
wiggling this block out.

42
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,850
And then it looks pretty
cool at that point.

43
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,057
Actually it was a student
in the class showed me this

44
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:03,390
a couple of years ago, because
we were doing the blocks.

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,780
The next thing we're going
to do-- we were doing that--

46
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,321
and he said, hey,
there's this thing.

47
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:08,150
And yeah, pretty cool.

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,039
So today we're going to
look at a different problem,

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,150
and that's the problem of
getting the blocks stacked up

50
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,950
so they go out over the edge of
the table-- if that's doable.

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:30,840
So the goal is to stack
the blocks up like this.

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,920
We go farther and farther out.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,410
And the question
we're going to look at

54
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,410
is is it possible-- whoa.

55
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:39,910
Almost.

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,909
Is it possible to get a block
all the way off the table?

57
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,700
That's the question
we're going to look at.

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,440
And here I got close.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,215
And you can see it's
getting a little tipsy.

60
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,090
It's not going to go.

61
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,450
It's going to fall over.

62
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,030
So I didn't do it this time.

63
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,360
You're only allowed
one block per level.

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,110
So you can't do
anything like this.

65
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,590
That's not allowed.

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,680
You can go backwards,
if that helps you.

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,570
Well it's got to be
stable on both sides.

68
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,220
But you can go back and forth.

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,370
So the question is, can you
get out one block totally

70
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,360
out over the table?

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,160
How many people think
it can't be done?

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,660
All right.

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,810
A few doubters.

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,830
More doubters.

75
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,180
How many think it can be done?

76
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,930
Oh, a lot of people
think it can be done.

77
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,750
OK.

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,300
Well all right.

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,540
How many people think
you can get a block

80
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,080
two blocks out over the table?

81
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,940
A few of you.

82
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,230
How many think you can
get it three blocks out?

83
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,020
You're believers.

84
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,430
OK.

85
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,840
How many people think
I can reach that wall?

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,540
Well I got to tell you I
can't reach the wall because--

87
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,123
AUDIENCE: The ceiling
gets in the way.

88
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

89
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,900
That's going to be hard to do.

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,560
But this is what we're
going to try to figure out.

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,280
And we're going to do it
with a little competition.

92
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,050
So we're going to have a team
of you go up against the TAs.

93
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,079
And the winner gets
candy to share.

94
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,519
The losing team gets the
infamous 6042 Nerd Pride pocket

95

96
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,940
Very nice.

101
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,730

you'd like to volunteer.

or at least win yourself
a pocket protector.

105
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,020
And we'll put the
class over there.

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,610
And we get the TAs to come down.

107
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,460
So come on down.

108
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,501
I got a couple of people.

109
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,920
Who else wants to join them?

110
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,420

We got some people coming down.

All right, come on over.

You got all the blocks you want.

118
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,660
We could even take
this thing down.

119
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,660
So here's your supply.

120
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,490
All right.

121
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,810
Now the TAs have a little
bit of an advantage,

122
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,960
because they've done this
before, some of them.

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,070
So you can give some advice
to your colleagues here.

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,460
So you got to get some blocks
out of the block supply.

125
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,751
Maybe we should take this down.

126
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,180
It's about to fall over anyway.

127
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,550
So yeah, how do
we get this down?

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,576
I'm not sure.

00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:41,570

You can't hold it.

182

It's got to stand up by itself.

out over the edge if you want.

Oh, they're getting close.

185
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,519
Oh, I think you might have
the top block out over.

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,860

And I'm afraid they
get the candy here.

So you can take these out and
share them with the class.

258

Oh, leave it that way.

259
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Leave it there.

260
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,970
I mean, we're going
to analyze yours,

261
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,553
because I can't begin
to analyze that.

262
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:50,740
All right.

263
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,460
Now watching this,
how many people

264
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,020
still think we can get it
all the way to the wall?

265
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,860
Ah, a few people.

266
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,830
In fact, if you stack
this high enough--

267
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,250
and we're going to analyze
how high it has to go--

268
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,870
you could reach the wall.

269
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,990
Now in fact we're going
to find that you probably

270
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,010
got to go out to the
stars to get that high

271
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,490
before you can reach the wall.

272
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,750
So it's not too practical.

273
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,130
Now what I want to do is
analyze this strategy.

274
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,880
And this sort of looks
like a nice design.

275
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,800
They got out there
with just five.

276
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,070
And they did a
particular approach

277
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,500
using what we could call
as the greedy algorithm.

278
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,580
We've seen greedy
algorithms before.

279
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,370
And they used another
greedy algorithm here.

280
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,820
Now what their greedy strategy
did-- and I'm going to redo it

281
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,770
here-- is stack all the
blocks right at the edge.

282
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,680
Line it up here and,
starting at the top,

283
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,230
push it out as
far as you can go.

284
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,250
Now in this case, we can
get it out about halfway,

285
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,889
because the center of mass of
this block is at halfway point.

286
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,680
And that better be
sitting over this block,

287
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,020
or it's going to tip.

288
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,860
So the top block goes out here.

289
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,590
Now I'm going to slide
the top two blocks out

290
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,738
as far as they go.

291
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,790
All right.

292
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,170
That's about the tip.

293
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,500
Then I slide the top three
out as far as they go.

294
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,840
Whoa!

295
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,600
Almost.

296
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,020
Oops.

297
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,030
Theory is always
easier than practice.

298
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,600
And now we do the
top four blocks.

299
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,120
And they did a better
job than I did.

300
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,960
But that's the algorithm,
OK, the greedy algorithm.

301
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,020
The top i blocks-- when i
goes 1 to n-- push it out

302
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,480
as far as you can go.

303
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,980
All right.

304
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,840
And we're going to
analyze that strategy

305
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,108
and see how far it goes.

306
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,410
So we're given n blocks.

307
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,365
And let's say they all have
length 1, to make it easy.

308
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,010
And we're going to define r
sub i to be the amount by which

309
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,380
the i'th block hangs
out over the edge.

310
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,691
and we're going to
count from the top.

311
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,330
All right.

312
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,270
So let's see this on a picture.

313
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,080
So I got the table here.

314
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:02,160
And then I'm stacking the blocks
out in some way like this.

315
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,555
And with a greedy strategy,
you don't ever go backwards.

316
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,900
All right.

317
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,980
So I'm defining this distance.

318
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,110
This is block one.

319
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:26,240
This distance here is r 1.

320
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,470
This distance is r 2.

321
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,710
This one is r 3-- and so forth,
until you get down to here.

322
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,080
This is r n, because
this is the n'th block,

323
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,610
and it extends out
r n from the table.

324
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,590
And this is 0 here,
which the table--

325
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,860
we'll consider the table to
be the n plus first block.

326
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,940
So r n plus 1 is 0.

327
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,330
OK.

328
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,820
And so using the strategy--
the greedy strategy--

329
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,170
we want to know what's r 1?

330
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,040
We want to compute that-- if
I keep pushing the blocks out

331
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,970
in a topward fashion
as far as they'll go.

332
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,850
Now the constraint is
the stability constraint

333
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,171
so it won't fall over.

334
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:24,970
The stability constraint says
that the center of mass--

335
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:37,010
we'll call it C k--
of the top k blocks

336
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,149
must lie on the k
plus first block.

337
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,190
Otherwise it'll tip over.

338
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,775
And of course the table is
block n plus 1 in this context.

339
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,840
OK.

340
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,550
So if at any point
we've got k blocks,

341
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,200
and their center of
mass is out here,

342
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,040
they'll fall over at that point.

343
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,850
Or if you are
building it this way,

344
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,390
they would fall over that way.

345
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,890
All right.

346
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,680
So for each set of the top
k blocks, the center of mass

347
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
has to be on the block below.

348
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,300
And if it is, we're fine.

349
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,602
It won't fall over.

350
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,840
Now for the greedy stacking.

351
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Where is the center
of mass of the top k

352
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,630
blocks in the greedy
stacking, the way

353
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,270
we defined them in terms
of these variables.

354
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,446
What is C k?

355
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,370
All right.

356
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:02,190
So I got the top k
blocks r k plus 1.

357
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,089
The center of mass of the top
k blocks by the greedy strategy

358
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,349
is right at the edge
of the k'th block.

359
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,131
So if this is a block k here,
then this is r k plus 1.

360
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,589
That's where the
center of mass has

361
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,500
to be of all these
blocks-- the top k blocks.

362
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,270
If it's a little bit more,
it's going to fall over.

363
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,480
If it's less, then
it's not greedy.

364
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,510
We didn't push it out
as far as it could go.

365
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,010
All right.

366
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,250
So for the greedy stacking,
C k is equal to r k plus 1.

367
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,090
And r n plus 1 of course
is the edge of the table.

368
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,830
That's zero.

369
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,540
Any questions so far?

370
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,500
What we're doing?

371
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,570
OK.

372
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,080
All right.

373
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,180
So let's figure out where the
center of mass of the top k

374
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,600
blocks is-- a formula for
that-- a recursive formula.

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
So to do that we look
at the center of mass

376
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,970
of the k'th block by itself,
and then average it in with

377
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,551
the center of mass of
the top k minus 1 blocks.

378
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:11,050
OK.

379
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,560
So we're going to set up a
recursion to compute C k.

380
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:23,150
Where is the center of mass of
the k'th block just by itself?

381
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,280
The center of mass
of the k'th block.

382
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,780
This guy.

383
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,970
Where is its center of mass?

384
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

385
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, r
k plus 1 minus 0.5.

386
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Because the center
of mass of this block

387
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,860
is 1/2 from the right edge.

388
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,450
And the right edge
is-- oh, it's r k.

389
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,315
Sorry.

390
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:46,900
All right?

391
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,590
The top.

392
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,560
Yeah this is.

393
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,060
What?

394
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,851
What did I do here?

395
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:50,451
Oh, the top k.

396
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:50,950
Sorry.

397
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,074
This is the k'th block,
the way I had it.

398
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:53,740
Here's the k'th.

399
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,519
So it is r k minus a half.

400
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,060
That's right.

401
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,161
This is r k plus 1 down here.

402
00:18:59,161 --> 00:18:59,660
All right.

403
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,730
Because the right edge of
the k'th block is at r k,

404
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,320
the center of mass
is 1/2 left of that.

405
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,820
All right.

406
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:20,860
So we know that the center of
mass of the k'th block is at r

407
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,180
k minus 1/2.

408
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,870
All right.

409
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,980
Now we can compute another
expression for C k.

410
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:45,610
The center of mass
of the top k blocks

411
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:53,660
is C k equals-- well there's
k minus 1 block centered

412
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,990
at C k minus 1, because
the center of mass

413
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,180
of the top k minus 1 block's
by definition is C k minus 1.

414
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,910
And they have weight k minus 1.

415
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,700
And then we average that with
a k'th block that has weight 1

416
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,930
at position r k minus 1/2.

417
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,980
And the total weight of
this is k minus 1 here,

418
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,160
and one for this block.

419
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:24,160
So this equals KC
k minus 1 minus--

420
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
let me write it better here.

421
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,860
k minus 1.

422
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:36,140
C k minus 1 plus R k
minus 1/2 all over k.

423
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,640
All right.

424
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,670
So now we've got an expression--
a recursive expression--

425
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,780
for C k.

426
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,425
And to simplify it, we're
going to plug in that-- C k

427
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:50,470
as r k plus 1 for
the greedy strategy.

428
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,104
Yeah?

429
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:54,570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

430
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,900
PROFESSOR: L is 1.

431
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,427
The length of the blocks is
1, here to make it simpler.

432
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:01,010
Otherwise it would
have been a half L.

433
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,890
So yesterday we talked
about length L blocks.

434
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,870
Today they're length
1, to be simple.

435
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,370
All right.

436
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,828
So now for the
greedy strategy, I'm

437
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:12,580
just going to plug
in C k as r k plus 1.

438
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,680
So let's do that.

439
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:24,830
So I got C k as r k plus
1 equals zero k minus 1.

440
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:37,090
Well C k minus 1 is just R
k plus R k minus 1/2 over K.

441
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,130
And this simplifies
to k r k minus r k

442
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:49,010
plus r k-- they cancel--
minus 1/2 over k.

443
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,790
This equals r k minus 1/2.

444
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,020
So getting very simple now.

445
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,780
And I'm just going
to rewrite this

446
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,950
to look at the difference
between r k and r k plus 1.

447
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,562
So r k minus r k plus 1 Oops.

448
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:08,270
I made a mistake.

449
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,700
That's 1 over 2 k.

450
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
Half over k is 1 over 2K.

451
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,921
Any questions about
the math we did?

452
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:21,420
Interesting.

453
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,970
This is one of those problems
where the math this way

454
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,099
is easy.

455
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,140
There are other ways to
try to solve this problem

456
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,380
and the math gets pretty hairy.

457
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,220
But this one's a
simple approach.

458
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,030
What's the meaning of this?

459
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,090
What's an interpretation
of r k minus r k plus 1?

460
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,703
Yeah.

461
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:40,578
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

462
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:43,590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

463
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,270
This is how much further the
k'th block sticks out over

464
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,160
the k plus first block.

465
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,398
So let's see that.

466
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:52,170
All right.

467
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,230
So here's r 1.

468
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,020
Here's r 2.

469
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,350
r 1 minus r 2 is the amount by
which the first block sticks

470
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,010
out over the second.

471
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,700
Here's r 2 two minus r 3.

472
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,841
It's that distance.

473
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:07,340
All right.

474
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,760
So we've gotten a formula for
the greedy strategy of how much

475
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,630
the k'th block sticks out
over the k plus first block.

476
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,311
And it's pretty simple.

477
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:17,810
All right.

478
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,740
So now we can write
down this expression

479
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,340
for all the values of k.

480
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,620
So what's r 1 minus r 2 going
to be in the greedy strategy?

481
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,480
How much is the top
block sticking out

482
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,130
over the second block
in the greedy strategy?

483
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,860
1/2.

484
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,140
Just plug in k equals 1.

485
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,758
r 2 minus r 3 equals--

486
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,105
AUDIENCE: A quarter.

487
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,880
One quarter.

488
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,430
r 3 minus r 4 is what?

489
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,270
6.

490
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,950
All right.

491
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,030
So now you can start to
see what the TAs did,

492
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,990
how it got smaller
each step going down

493
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,250
all the way to the end here.

494
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:13,326
You get r n-- the n'th block--
minus the table is 1 over 2 n.

495
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,010
All right.

496
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,980
Now there's a very
easy way to figure out

497
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,970
what r 1 is, which
is what we're after.

498
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,630
How far out is the top block?

499
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,880
What do I do?

500
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,170
Add them all together.

501
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,520
And everything cancels.

502
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,430
So I get r 1 minus r n
plus 1 equals 1/2 plus 1/4

503
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,910
plus 1/6 out to 1 over 2 n.

504
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,350
All right.

505
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:55,210
So that's just equal to the
sum i equal 1 to n 1 over 2 1.

506
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,710
All right.

507
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,990
Now I got r 1 minus r n plus 1.

508
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,810
But what's r n plus 1?

509
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,350
0.

510
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,080
That's the table.

511
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,980
The table doesn't
hang out over itself.

512
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:16,320
So in fact r 1 equals a half
of the sum of the inverses

513
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,420
of the first n integers.

514
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,460
OK?

515
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,760
And so now all we have to
do is to compute this sum

516
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,350
to know how far out it is.

517
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,090
In fact, this sum
comes up so often

518
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,260
in mathematics and computer
science, it has a special name.

519
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,150
It's called the harmonic sum.

520
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,790
And the numbers are called
the harmonic numbers.

521
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:49,860
And in particular, the
n'th harmonic number

522
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,990
is typically denoted
H n just equals

523
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,655
the sum of the n reciprocals.

524
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,810
All right.

525
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,810
So for example, the first
harmonic number is 1.

526
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:10,510
The second is 1
plus 1/2 equals 3/2.

527
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:21,130
The third is 3/2 plus
1/3, which is 11/6.

528
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:27,340
The fourth harmonic
number is that plus 1/4.

529
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,816
22 plus 3/12 is 25/12.

530
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:33,990
That's sort of an
interesting number,

531
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,380
because it's bigger than 2.

532
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,691
What does that tell us?

533
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:41,565
Why is that interesting
from this perspective

534
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:44,790
of what we're doing here?

535
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,070
Now you can get a
block off the table.

536
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,230
Because R1, the distance
that the top block hangs out

537
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,690
off the table, is half
the harmonic number.

538
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,930
Half of H 4 is a little
bit bigger than 1.

539
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,580
Which means with four blocks the
top block can be off the table.

540
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,880
Now the TAs did it using five.

541
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,780
I didn't even get it
to work with five.

542
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,950
In theory it'll work with 12.

543
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,380
You can hang one out
there just a 24th

544
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,040
beyond the edge of
the table in theory.

545
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,540
All right.

546
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,920
If we kept on going,
h of a million--

547
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,490
the millionth harmonic number,
if you were to go compute it,

548
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:29,000
is 14.3927 and some other stuff.

549
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,910
So if I had a million
blocks stacked up, in theory

550
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,230
how far would I get the
top block off the table?

551
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,910
Seven blocks.

552
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,410
All right.

553
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,493
So that gives you an idea.

554
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:44,020
You have to do a lot
of work to get seven.

555
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,720
And in fact it's hard,
because the bottom block

556
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,500
would be hanging out one
two millionth of a block.

557
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,000
All right?

558
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,670
So you're adding up
a lot of tiny things

559
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,800
to get to seven out there.

560
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,860
Now it turns out that
the harmonic numbers

561
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,729
grow to infinity.

562
00:27:58,729 --> 00:27:59,520
And we'll see that.

563
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,760
But they grow very, very slowly.

564
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,890
And to see that, we need to
get a closed-form expression

565
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,130
for this sum.

566
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,210
Now does anybody know a
closed-form expression

567
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,690
for the sum of 1 over i?

568
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,750
I don't think so,
because I don't

569
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,575
know anybody who knows that.

570
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:25,150
In fact it's [? probably ?]
believed that it doesn't exist.

571
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,208
So what do we do to get a
good estimation of that sum?

572
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,852
What do we do?

573
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,060
AUDIENCE: Integration bounds.

574
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,110
PROFESSOR: The
integration bounds.

575
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,450
Yeah.

576
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,410
Because we're not going
to get a closed form.

577
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,260
At least I don't know of
anybody who knows how to do it.

578
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,810
So we'll use the
integration bounds.

579
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,460
And what kind of
function are we summing?

580
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,000
Is it increasing or decreasing?

581
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,660
Decreasing.

582
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,790
Yep.

583
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,158
So we'll use the formula
we did last time.

584
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:14,720
All right.

585
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:23,980
And that formula is that the
sum i equals 1 to n of f of i

586
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,042
is, at most, the first
term plus the integral.

587
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,370
And it's at least the last
term plus the integral.

588
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,600
All right.

589
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,680
In this case we have
f of i as 1 over i.

590
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,197
So the first step is to
compute the integral.

591
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,530
And that's pretty easy.

592
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:08,520
That's just the natural log
of x evaluated at n and 1.

593
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,070
And that's easy.

594
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,990
That's just the
natural log of n.

595
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,930
So the integral
is very easy here.

596
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,720
And now we actually
can just plug in

597
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,883
and get really good bounds.

598
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,868
Maybe I'll save
that just in case.

599
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,740
OK so plugging in
into the bounds f of n

600
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,620
is 1 over n plus the
integral is log of n

601
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,860
is less than or equal to
the n'th harmonic number.

602
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,190
And it's upper
bounded by f of 1,

603
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,798
which is 1 plus the integral.

604
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:02,550
All right.

605
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,520
So that's really good.

606
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,410
We got very tight bounds.

607
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,220
And now you can see that
the n'th harmonic number--

608
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,800
how fast is it growing?

609
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,620
If I were to use tilde
notation, what would I write?

610
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,381
As log n.

611
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:15,880
Yeah.

612
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,047
So this means that h
of n is tilde log of n.

613
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,080
Now this is such an
important function

614
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,640
that people have gone
to a lot of extra work--

615
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,810
which we can't do in this
class-- to really nail down

616
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,260
the value-- get it much closer.

617
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,560
And in fact it's now known
that it's the natural log of n

618
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:49,360
plus 1 over 2n plus 1 over
12n squared plus epsilon of n

619
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:58,080
over 120n to the
fourth where for all n

620
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,730
epsilon n is between 0 and 1.

621
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,160
Oop.

622
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,230
And I left one piece out.

623
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,990
Actually there's a constant
term in here-- delta--

624
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,230
that's called Euler's constant.

625
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:21,630
Delta is called
Euler's constant,

626
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:32,131
and equals 0.577215664
and some other stuff.

627
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:33,630
And in fact to this
day people don't

628
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,760
know if this constant is
rational or irrational.

629
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,200
But they know it to a
lot of decimal places.

630
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,250
So basically H n is the log of n
plus some fixed value between 0

631
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,110
and 1-- as we knew
it had to be--

632
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,120
plus even some tail
terms here that

633
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,630
get very small as n gets large.

634
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,130
All right.

635
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,070
So say I wanted to using
this greedy strategy.

636
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,750
How many blocks I would need
to get a block 100 blocks out

637
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,700
over the end of the table.

638
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,300
So I want to go 100 blocks out.

639
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,880
How many blocks do I need
using this strategy, roughly?

640
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,390
What is it?

641
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,190
I think somebody said it.

642
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:30,020
So I want to get r 1 to be 100.

643
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,070
So I need the harmonic
number to be 200.

644
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,401
And what does this tell me
about n to get this to be 200?

645
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,100
e to the 200.

646
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,600
All right.

647
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,030
So you're going to
need an exponential

648
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,350
in 200 number of blocks, which
now we're past the stars,

649
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,340
all right, to get that many.

650
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:54,840
All right.

651
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,480
Now we won't prove it in class,
but this strategy-- the TA

652
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,710
greedy strategy-- is optimal.

653
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,660
There is no way to get a block
farther out over the edge.

654
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,080
That said, there is a
second way to get there.

655
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,380
And in the second way, the top
block is not the optimal block.

656
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,196
In the second way, it's the
second block that goes out.

657
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:19,529
So it looks something like that.

658
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,730
So there's a
counterweight on it.

659
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,320
And in the text, when
you read chapter nine,

660
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,699
you will see the proof
that shows that there's

661
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,000
two solutions that are optimal.

662
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,666
One's a greedy, and
one's this other one

663
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,599
that sort of is mostly the
greedy, except the top couple

664
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,810
of blocks are different.

665
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,150
And it proves that's optimal.

666
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,790
We won't cover that in class.

667
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,830
Now actually in the
literature today people

668
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,900
have been studying how
far a block can go out

669
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,310
if you're allowed to do more
than one block per level,

670
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,870
like one of the
students wanted to do.

671
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,429
So if you're allowed
to have multiple blocks

672
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,460
on the same level, it turns
out you can get much farther

673
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,900
out with n blocks.

674
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,400
And right now it's known
that it's something like n

675
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,830
to the third is how
far you can get out,

676
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,310
which is much better
than log of n.

677
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,950
And so mathematicians have
been studying that problem.

678
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,420
Any questions about
the block stacking?

679
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,331
OK.

680
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:19,830
All right.

681
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,130
So that's basically it for sums.

682
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,190
I do want to spend a little
time talking about products.

683
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,340
And that may get us back
into sums pretty quick.

684
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,690
The most famous product
out there is n factorial.

685
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,900
And once we get to
counting and probability,

686
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,410
probably every
lecture we're going

687
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,530
to be looking at n factorial
one way or another.

688
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,595
Just comes up all the time.

689
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:54,610
n factorial is the product
of i equals 1 to n of i.

690
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:02,530
It's the product of the first
n natural numbers after zero.

691
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,280
Now we'd like to be able to
get a closed-form expression

692
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,600
for this, because factorial
is really not closed form,

693
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,870
because it's hiding this thing.

694
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,040
And if I ask you how big is
n factorial, sort of hard

695
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,560
to say how big it is,
how fast it grows.

696
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,970
Any ideas about how we might
go about doing a product to get

697
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,676
a closed-form expression?

698
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:28,634
AUDIENCE: If you take a
logarithm of a product,

699
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:29,770
you get a sum.

700
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.

701
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,341
Take the log of it.

702
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,980
Well, let's write that out--
1 times 2 times 3 to n.

703
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,470
That equals the log of
1 plus the log of 2.

704
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:50,847
Whoops.

705
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:53,940
All right.

706
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,420
So I've now got a sum.

707
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:05,150
And now that I've got a sum
we can use all the tools

708
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,650
we had for sums.

709
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,750
So really, products
look hairy, but they're

710
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,399
no different than sums.

711
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,190
Because we're going to
get an approximation

712
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,640
or get an answer for
[? login ?] n factorial.

713
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,660
Then we'll exponentiate it,
and we'll have the answer.

714
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,160
All right.

715
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,540
So we're looking at this sum.

716
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,200
And so how do I get a
closed form for that?

717
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,010
Turns out nobody
knows the closed form.

718
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,100
But we do know a method that
approximates it very well,

719
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,470
which is the integration bounce.

720
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,450
Only in this case, it's
an increasing function.

721
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,320
So let's do that.

722
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:05,960
OK.

723
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,930
So let's do that.

724
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,760
And the formula is easy.

725
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,770
It's basically the same
formula we had there--

726
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,740
that the sum i equals
1 to n of f of i

727
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,996
is at most the n'th
term plus the integral.

728
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,590
And it's at least the first
term plus the integral.

729
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:47,760
All right.

730
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,165
Now in this case f
of i is the log of i.

731
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:03,300
And so we need to compute
the integral of log of x.

732
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,060
And that's easy.

733
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:11,950
That's x ln of x minus
x evaluated at n and 1.

734
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,641
And that's just n
log of n minus n.

735
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,250
If I plug in 1, I get a 0 here,
and I'm subtracting negative 1

736
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,901
there.

737
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:26,400
All right.

738
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,633
And so now we'll just plug
this into the integral

739
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:31,674
and we'll get our bounce.

740
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,700
So f of 1.

741
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,370
What is f of 1 in this case?

742
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,980
Yeah, 0.

743
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,140
Plus n ln n minus
n plus 1 less than

744
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:59,580
equal to log of n factorial,
less than or equal to f of n

745
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,770
is log of n.

746
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,340
OK.

747
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,690
So to get bounds on
n factorial, we just

748
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,770
exponentiate both sides.

749
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,300
So I take e to this,
gives me-- well, that's

750
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,205
going to give n to the n here.

751
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:24,080
And this is negative.

752
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,822
That'll be e to the n minus 1.

753
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,170
And here I've got n plus
1 times the log of n.

754
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,680
So it's n to the n plus
1 over the same thing--

755
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,710
e to the n minus 1.

756
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,160
So we got very close bounds.

757
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,570
They're within a factor of
n-- which sounds like a lot,

758
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,450
but compared to how big n
factorial is, not so bad.

759
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,205
Pretty good bounds there.

760
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:54,705
OK.

761
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,570
So n factorial's about n
over e to the n'th power.

762
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,180
Now this is so important
that-- even more important

763
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,060
than harmonic numbers-- people
have gone to a lot of effort

764
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,970
to get very tight
bounds on n factorial.

765
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,386
So let me tell you
what those are.

766
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:21,045
It's called Stirling's formula.

767
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:35,650
And that says that n
factorial equals n over e

768
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:42,230
to the n'th power times the
square root of 2 pi n times

769
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:54,770
e to the epsilon n where
epsilon n is between 1 over 12n

770
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:00,670
plus 1 and 1 over 12n.

771
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,430
So it's epsilon n is
going to 0 as n gets big.

772
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,921
So e to something going
to 0 is going to 1.

773
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:08,420
All right.

774
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,000
So another way of
looking at this

775
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,270
is you could put a
tilde here, all right,

776
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,490
and ignore that term.

777
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,310
And that's called
Stirling's formula.

778
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,670
This is a good thing to
have on your crib sheet

779
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,110
for the midterm.

780
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,040
So very likely
there'll be something

781
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,700
where you've got to have
some kind of analysis

782
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,370
of n factorial, and to
know how fast it's growing.

783
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,860
Now these bounds you
get here are very tight.

784
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:42,330
For example, 100
factorial is at least 100

785
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:50,520
over e to 100 times square
root 200 pi, times e to the 1

786
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,960
over 1,201.

787
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,880
This thing is just really tiny.

788
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:03,080
This thing here is
1.0008329 and something.

789
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,710
And 100 factorial
is lower-bounded

790
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:15,040
by the same things, only here
it's e to the 1 over 1,200.

791
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:24,100
And that is very close
to 1-- 1.00083368.

792
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,850
So the difference
in these bounds

793
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,770
is a tiny fraction of 1%.

794
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,360
So the bound you get
from Stirling's formula

795
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,476
is very, very close
to the right answer.

796
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,659
Any questions on
Stirling's formula?

797
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,450
We won't derive it.

798
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,407
You can derive that in
a graduate math class.

799
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,365
They do that sometimes.

800
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,615
More typically you'll
see it without that e

801
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:56,940
to the error term.

802
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,540
And you just see n
factorial written

803
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:05,930
as tilde, and over e to
the n, square root 2 pi n.

804
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,430
All right?

805
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,610
Because that e to the epsilon
n goes to 1 in the limit.

806
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,490
So it sort of disappears when
you go to the tilde notation.

807
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,900
And this in fact is
a lower bound on n

808
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,510
factorial, and very close
to the right answer.

809
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,010
Now this is sort of
an amazing formula.

810
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,010
I mean who would think that
when you look at n factorial

811
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,640
that the expression
would have e and pi

812
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,120
in the expression for it?

813
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,930
Maybe e.

814
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,640
Maybe.

815
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,330
But what's pi doing
in n factorial?

816
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,410
It's sort of a bizarre thing.

817
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,470
OK.

818
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,660
That's it for products.

819
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,285
We're just going to
do the one example,

820
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,530
because really any product just
becomes a sum through the log.

821
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,590
And that makes it really easy.

822
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,900
Any questions on
sums and products?

823
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,940
Because I'm going to totally
change gears now and talk

824
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,760
about more things like tilde.

825
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:05,796
OK.

826
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,340
So we're going to talk today
and tomorrow in recitation

827
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,690
about asymptotic notation.

828
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:24,130
It is used all over the
place in computer science.

829
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,810
We've already seen one example,
which is the tilde notation.

830
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:33,150
And it turns out there's
five more things like that

831
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,911
which we're going to learn what
they are and how they work.

832
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,530
They're used to
explain or describe how

833
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,330
a function grows in the limit.

834
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,540
So for example, we had
the tilde notation.

835
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:04,680
And we wrote f of x is tilde
g of x if the limit as x goes

836
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,223
to infinity of f over g is 1.

837
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,280
Now the next one--
and most commonly

838
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,910
used one in computer
science-- is

839
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:23,200
called the O notation,
or the big O.

840
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,760
And it's written like this.

841
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:31,100
f of x equals O of g of x.

842
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:37,100
And it means that
the limit as x goes

843
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,560
to infinity of the
absolute value of f

844
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,510
of x over g of x
is convergence--

845
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,210
is less than infinity.

846
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:55,760
So it's finite, and
it can't diverge.

847
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,730
The interpretation
is that this function

848
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:05,860
is up to constant factors
upper-bounded by this one,

849
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,690
that this grows the same rate
or slower than this one grows

850
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,880
as x gets large.

851
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,450
Because if f was growing a lot
faster than g in the limit,

852
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,520
then the limit would be
the ratio is infinity.

853
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,521
And we're saying
that doesn't happen.

854
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:23,020
All right.

855
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,630
I'm not going to do a
lot of examples for this.

856
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,400
In fact, let's go over here.

857
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,544
There's several other ways
you'll see it written.

858
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,460
For example, you'll
see people write

859
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,270
f of x is less
than or equal to O

860
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,550
of g of x, because the
natural interpretation is

861
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,950
f is not growing faster than
g-- sort of upper-bounded by g.

862
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:13,060
You'll see people write
f of x is O of g of x.

863
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,440
And the formal math way
that people don't use,

864
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,590
but it's the
formally correct one,

865
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:23,750
is f of x is an
element of O of g of x.

866
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,890
And the interpretation
there is that O of g of x

867
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,950
is a set of functions that
don't grow any faster than g.

868
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,810
And f is one of them.

869
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,357
You can use any of
these and that's fine.

870
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:36,065
People will know what
you mean, and it'll

871
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:38,560
be fine for the class.

872
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,060
All right.

873
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:44,513
Let's see some examples, and see
how to prove a big O relation.

874
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,480
Let f of x be the
function x, and g

875
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,670
of x be the function x squared.

876
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,900
Then in this case
f of x is O of g

877
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,280
of x-- because x doesn't
grow any faster than x

878
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,940
squared as x gets large.

879
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,510
To prove it, we
take the limit as x

880
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:18,700
goes to infinity of
x over x squared.

881
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,040
That is equal to what?

882
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,920
What is the limit of x over x
squared as x goes to infinity?

883
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,350
0.

884
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:32,000
And that is less than infinity.

885
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,960
So we proved it.

886
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,350
So if you get asked to prove
f is O of g, what you do

887
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,860
is you take the limit of f
over g as x goes to infinity

888
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,871
and show that it
doesn't diverge.

889
00:49:47,871 --> 00:49:48,530
All right.

890
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,258
Let's do another example.

891
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:55,400
In this case we'll show
that f is not O of g.

892
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,232
x squared is not O of x.

893
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:08,360
Of course, x squared
grows faster than x,

894
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,783
but let's see why not.

895
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,010
Well we take the limit
as x goes to infinity

896
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,130
of x squared over x.

897
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,920
And what is that limit?

898
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,870
Infinity.

899
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,360
And so it can't be true
that it's x squared

900
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,541
is O of x, because it has
to be less than infinity.

901
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:32,296
Yeah?

902
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:32,962
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

903
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:33,819
I missed it.

904
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:34,360
What's alpha?

905
00:50:37,227 --> 00:50:38,060
PROFESSOR: Infinity.

906
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,770
Sorry.

907
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,050
Infinity.

908
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:42,350
There we go.

909
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,808
That's important
in the definition.

910
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:44,763
Yep.

911
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:45,263
Good.

912
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,390
All right.

913
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,190
What about this?

914
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:59,450
Is x squared equal O
of a million times x?

915
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,630
Yes?

916
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,811
No?

917
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:08,560
What do you think?

918
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,166
This looks pretty darn big.

919
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,470
AUDIENCE: It's a constant.

920
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,750
PROFESSOR: That a constant.

921
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:23,670
So in the limit, as x goes
to infinity, this over that

922
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,541
is infinite.

923
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,040
All right.

924
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,720
So no.

925
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,250
Because the limit of
x goes to infinity

926
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:40,180
of x squared over 10 to the
sixth x, that equals infinity.

927
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,300
So the thing with
this big O notation

928
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,390
is you just ignore
our constant factors.

929
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,650
They don't do anything.

930
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:47,914
Just forget about them.

931
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,690
What about this?

932
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:59,828
Is 10 to the sixth x
equal O of x squared?

933
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,010
Yes.

934
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:06,819
Because you just
ignore the constant.

935
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,360
That's what the big
O is for, and why

936
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,810
it's used all the time
in computer science.

937
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,670
So yes, that's true.

938
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,260
The proof is very simple.

939
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:23,280
The limit as x goes to infinity
of 100 x squared-- whoops.

940
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,110
I could even put a square there.

941
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:31,780
10 to the sixth x squared over
x squared is 10 to the sixth.

942
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,080
That's less than infinity.

943
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,380
In fact, I could take
any quadratic polynomial.

944
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:47,410
x squared plus 100x plus 10 to
the seventh is O of x squared.

945
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,140
Because smaller order
terms don't matter.

946
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,880
The limit of this here over
that in that case is 1.

947
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,192
So it's less than
infinity as x gets big.

948
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,236
All right let's do a few more.

949
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,660
This really is not so hard.

950
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,770
It's a little dull.

951
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,401
But you've got to
know it for later.

952
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:21,960
OK.

953
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,740
I could take classes like
6046, and you'll never

954
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,040
see any constants, because
everything is things like big O

955
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,040
and the other notation
we'll talk about.

956
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,050
What about this?

957
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,490
X to the 10th equal
O of e to the x.

958
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,175
Is x to the 10 O of e to the x?

959
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,740
Yeah, it is.

960
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,870
So this is a theorem.

961
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,240
Proof.

962
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,730
Limit as x goes to infinity.

963
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,680
x to the 10 over e to the x.

964
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,185
That equals 0, which is
certainly less than infinity.

965
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,310
All right.

966
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,070
Now the reason this
stuff is useful

967
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,310
when you're doing the
analysis of algorithms

968
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,590
is because when you're
talking about things

969
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,410
like matrix multiplication
algorithms or things like that,

970
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,580
the actual running time
depends on the machine you're

971
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,950
dealing with-- the machine
characteristics-- details

972
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,097
in how you count steps
of the algorithm.

973
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,805
For example, doing
matrix multiplication,

974
00:54:28,805 --> 00:54:33,160
do you count multiply different
than you count plus addition?

975
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,440
And if you start getting
caught up in all those details

976
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,880
you lose the important
fact of the algorithm.

977
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,440
For example, matrix
multiplication--

978
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,320
the elementary algorithm takes
order O of n cubed steps.

979
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,930
And that's the important fact.

980
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,070
And it tells you that if you
double the size of the matrix

981
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,960
the running time will increase
by at most a factor of eight

982
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,890
in the limit as n gets large.

983
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:03,300
And so you might write
things like the time

984
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:08,450
to multiply n by n matrices.

985
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:16,990
You might call that t of n,
and then state that is O of n

986
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,390
cubed.

987
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:19,890
All right.

988
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,970
And you don't have to
worry about what computer

989
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,470
it's running on,
exactly how you're

990
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,580
counting the details of what
a step is or what time is.

991
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,350
The important thing
is that it's growing

992
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:35,490
at most as a cubic of
the size of the matrices.

993
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:41,730
And so in 6046 and 6006
you will spend lots of time

994
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,040
proving that things
are the running time,

995
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:50,313
or the size is O of some
function of the input size.

996
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:50,812
All right.

997
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,340
Any questions?

998
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:55,845
Yeah.

999
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:56,720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1000
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:06,150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1001
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,580
It gets all dicey if you
do oscillatory things.

1002
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,350
And it depends
how you define it.

1003
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,360
So we're going to
stay away from that

1004
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,730
and just stick with
this definition.

1005
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,280
So if this guy
oscillates-- like f

1006
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,660
is a sine of x,
sine of x is O of x.

1007
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,160
All right.

1008
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,060
It doesn't have to converge.

1009
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,380
But as long as the ratio
is less than infinity.

1010
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,444
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1011
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:30,110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1012
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,500
Everything you do.

1013
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,250
Maybe you'll see sine
functions sometimes.

1014
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,708
But everything you
do in algorithms

1015
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,350
is going to be
growing monotonically.

1016
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:36,850
Yeah.

1017
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,660
Nothing-- no wacky
stuff in math usually.

1018
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,790
Any other questions?

1019
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,555
Yeah.

1020
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:45,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sort of comparing

1021
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,890
something that's the same
magnitude that you go off

1022
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:49,784
into infinity.

1023
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:50,450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1024
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,006
It's upper bounded.

1025
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:52,880
So it's not the same.

1026
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,296
We'll get to the
same in a minute.

1027
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:55,310
But it's upper bounded.

1028
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,950
f is upper bounded by g
up to a fixed constant

1029
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,820
as you go to infinity.

1030
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,949
And all constants get
washed away by O. Yeah.

1031
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:05,824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1032
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,840
PROFESSOR: Ah, why is this true?

1033
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,920
Well technically we'd have
to go back to calculus

1034
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,510
and use L'Hopital's rule
or something like that,

1035
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,520
because this function
exponential grows a lot faster

1036
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,370
than x to the tenth.

1037
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,620
So L'Hopital's rule is you
take the derivative of this

1038
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,900
over the derivative of that.

1039
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,850
Then you'd have x to the
ninth over e to the x.

1040
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,780
You do it nine more times.

1041
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,150
And you'd get 10
factorial over e to the x.

1042
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,000
And that limit is zero.

1043
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,150
So that's how you'd actually
do it using L'Hopital's rule.

1044
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,240
Yep.

1045
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,420
Any polynomial grows slower
than any exponential.

1046
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,090
All right.

1047
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,940
Let's now do some examples
that can get you screwed up.

1048
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,790
What about this one?

1049
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:01,311
Is 4 to the x O to 2 to the x?

1050
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,180
Is that true?

1051
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,830
No, it's not true.

1052
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,710
I mean, the mistake
you might make

1053
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,940
is say, oh, 4 and 2,
4 is only double 2.

1054
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,750
Big O wipes out
constant factors.

1055
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,360
So the answer is yes.

1056
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,740
That would be bad.

1057
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,770
Better to look at the limit.

1058
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,760
So we'll state the correct
theorem-- 4 to the x

1059
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,970
is not O of 2 to the x.

1060
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,590
And the proof is obtained
by looking at the limit

1061
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,060
as x goes to infinity of 4
to the x over 2 to the x.

1062
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,660
That is just the limit 4
to the x over 2 to the x

1063
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,000
is 2 to the x.

1064
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,730
That's infinity.

1065
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,556
So the limit is not bounded.

1066
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:50,510
All right?

1067
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,701
So it is not big O there.

1068
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:54,380
All right.

1069
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,060
Here is one.

1070
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,270
Is 10 O of 1?

1071
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:08,790
I've purposely
written it this way.

1072
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,940
Yes, it is.

1073
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,770
And in fact the
interpretation here

1074
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,570
is that you've got
some function f

1075
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,310
of x that's just
always equal to 10,

1076
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:22,550
and some function g of x
that's always equal to 1.

1077
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,070
And then it is true in this
case that f of x is O of g of x.

1078
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:29,350
All right.

1079
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:36,020
But any constant function is O
of any other constant function.

1080
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,690
We're going to revisit
this in a nastier

1081
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,895
scenario in a little bit.

1082
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:41,395
OK.

1083
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:50,670
Sometimes you'll see
notation like this.

1084
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,890
H of n-- in fact, we
saw this earlier--

1085
00:59:53,890 --> 01:00:00,770
is the log of n plus
delta plus O of 1 over n.

1086
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,310
When we wrote out the formula
for the n'th harmonic number,

1087
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,260
it was log of n plus
Euler's constant plus

1088
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,200
something like 1 over n,
constant times 1 over n.

1089
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,750
And then some even
smaller terms.

1090
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,390
And so people will
write it like this.

1091
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:19,840
And it tells you that the
error terms grow no faster

1092
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,260
than a constant times 1 over n.

1093
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,400
Technically this is the
wrong way to write it.

1094
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,260
But everybody does
it, so you can too.

1095
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,320
What it means is this.

1096
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,881
H of n minus ln of n minus
delta is O of 1 over n.

1097
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:37,380
All right.

1098
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,050
That's the correct
way to write it,

1099
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,790
because you're taking the
ratio of this over that.

1100
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,540
This is how people will do it.

1101
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,040
All right.

1102
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,260
So just make sure you
understand that, what it means

1103
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,070
when you put it over there.

1104
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,150
Same thing with tilde notation.

1105
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,230
People will write this-- H of
n is tilde ln of n plus Euler's

1106
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,360
constant.

1107
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,360
The right way to write it
is Hn minus Euler's constant

1108
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,720
is tilde ln of n.

1109
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,190
Now can anybody tell me
why this is really not

1110
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,570
a good thing to do?

1111
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,320
And you think of how
things get really

1112
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,996
screwed up if you allow
to start doing this?

1113
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:22,370
Can you think of
anything that--?

1114
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:26,280
What if I did this?

1115
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,093
Is this true?

1116
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:31,930
10.

1117
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,400
The n'th harmonic
is harmonic number

1118
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,180
is tilde of log of n plus 10.

1119
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:41,760
Is that true?

1120
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,050
Think about that.

1121
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,247
People are shaking their heads.

1122
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,330
I mean how can it be true?

1123
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,090
Because we know this is.

1124
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,700
We know that's what it is.

1125
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,730
In fact, this is true.

1126
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,000
I can even make it a million.

1127
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,470
10 to the sixth here.

1128
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,530
It's true.

1129
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:08,560
Because the ratio of this over
that in the limit is what?

1130
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,360
1.

1131
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,091
And that's all I need for tilde.

1132
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:16,590
All right.

1133
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:21,730
So when I wrote this,
everybody knew what I meant.

1134
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,960
But I could write this and be
just as true mathematically.

1135
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,640
And so you've got to be
sort of careful about this.

1136
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,840
Really, the right
way to do it is this,

1137
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,880
because now we're
taking off that term,

1138
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,820
and then it's-- actually
I did this wrong.

1139
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,860
I should've put the [INAUDIBLE].

1140
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,200
Whoops.

1141
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,408
I should've done it this way.

1142
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:37,490
Let me rewrite that.

1143
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:40,710
The right way to do it is
H of n-- yeah-- is this.

1144
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,560
You put the small
term out over here.

1145
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,740
That's the right way.

1146
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,380
Because now it's not true
that it's 10 to the sixth out

1147
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,050
here-- all right-- for the
ratio of that over this guy.

1148
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:52,550
All right.

1149
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:53,740
So you can do it.

1150
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,750
But be careful,
because you might

1151
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,790
write wrong things
that technically

1152
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,400
would fit the definition.

1153
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,040
Same thing with big
O. Same problem there.

1154
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,365
Any questions about that?

1155
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,080
All right.

1156
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,580
All right.

1157
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:17,780
Now one thing that people do all
the time that you cannot do is

1158
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,132
to use big O as a lower bound.

1159
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,370
All right.

1160
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,710
So that's one abuse that we
won't-- you'll get marked wrong

1161
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:31,380
for doing that, even though
famous researchers will do it,

1162
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,754
and you'll probably even have
a professor do it sometime.

1163
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,760
So you may not do this.

1164
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,270
f of x is bigger than
or equal to O of g of x.

1165
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,123
That is meaningless.

1166
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,440
Because the whole point of big
O is that it's an upper bound.

1167
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,230
So you can't use it
as a lower bound.

1168
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,670
And the reason
you can't do it is

1169
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:03,820
because there is another symbol
to do what you want to do.

1170
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:07,960
And that's called
the omega symbol.

1171
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,495
And it's written like this.

1172
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,810
It's a capital omega.

1173
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:24,020
And it's if the limit as x goes
to infinity of f of x over g

1174
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,640
of x is greater than zero.

1175
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,210
OK.

1176
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,500
So now we're getting
the lower bound version.

1177
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,355
In fact it's just the
opposite of big O.

1178
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:39,080
In fact, we'll state a theorem.

1179
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,060
Not hard to prove.

1180
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,800
We won't do it.

1181
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:50,210
f of x equals O of g of
x if and only if g of x

1182
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:54,120
equals big omega of f of x.

1183
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:01,280
In other words, f
grows no faster than g

1184
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,590
if and only if g grows
at least as fast as f.

1185
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,640
One's an upper bound one.

1186
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,010
One's a lower bound.

1187
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:11,430
And you've just got to use
the symbol the right way.

1188
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,070
Now you can do this.

1189
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:19,620
You can write f of x bigger
than or equal to omega g of x.

1190
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,750
That's OK.

1191
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:22,250
All right?

1192
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,130
That's all right to do.

1193
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:24,630
All right.

1194
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,588
Let's do some examples.

1195
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:36,360
So x squared is omega of x,
because it grows faster than x.

1196
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,910
2 to the x is
omega of x squared.

1197
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,960
All right.

1198
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:06,260
x over 100 is omega
of 100x plus 25,

1199
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,580
because constants don't matter.

1200
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,970
x over 100 grows
at least as fast

1201
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:14,940
as 100x does in terms, because
we're measuring the growth.

1202
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,670
So constants go away.

1203
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,830
If you want to say the
running time of that algorithm

1204
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:25,590
is at least quadratic,
you would write T of n

1205
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:28,502
is omega n squared.

1206
01:06:28,502 --> 01:06:29,190
All right.

1207
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:33,310
And that says that the running
time is at least n squared.

1208
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:37,570
Any questions on big omega?

1209
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:42,380
Not too hard once you have
big O. It's just the opposite.

1210
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:46,890
All right the next
symbol is the version

1211
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,020
of equality, where you're
bigger-- at least as big

1212
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,240
as, and at most as big as.

1213
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,180
There's a special
symbol for that.

1214
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,585
So in that case we use theta.

1215
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,210
And we say that f
of x equals theta

1216
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:15,130
of g of x if the limit
is both bigger than 0

1217
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:19,280
and less than infinity.

1218
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,780
All right.

1219
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:24,400
So it's just a shorthand way
of saying big O and big omega.

1220
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,400
That's what theta means.

1221
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,720
It just both hold true.

1222
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,220
All right.

1223
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,430
And that's a theorem which
is not hard to prove,

1224
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,990
but we won't do it.

1225
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:41,280
f of x equals theta of g
of x if and only f of the x

1226
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:49,770
equals O of g of x and f
of x equals omega g of x.

1227
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:53,650
All right.

1228
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,845
So let's do some
examples of theta.

1229
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:18,680
So for example, 10x cubed
minus 20x plus 1 is more easily

1230
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:24,340
written as theta of x cubed--
because the constants don't

1231
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:24,840
matter.

1232
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,319
The low order
terms don't matter.

1233
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:28,859
What about this?

1234
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:34,460
Is x over log of x,
is that theta of x?

1235
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,760
x over log of x.

1236
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,500
Is that theta of x?

1237
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,979
People are nodding their heads.

1238
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:46,880
Hmm.

1239
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,750
Let's see.

1240
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,319
Let's check.

1241
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:57,560
The limit as x goes to
infinity of x over log

1242
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,660
of x divided by x.

1243
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,920
Well, the x's cancel.

1244
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:11,240
That's the limit as x goes to
infinity of 1 over log of x.

1245
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,399
What's that?

1246
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,460
0.

1247
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,640
Uh-oh.

1248
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,830
it is not theta.

1249
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,300
I got to be bigger than zero.

1250
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:27,880
In fact, this grows
more slowly than that--

1251
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,250
strictly more slowly.

1252
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,930
All right.

1253
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,020
A little more slowly,
but strictly more slowly.

1254
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,520
All right.

1255
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,729
If I use for an
algorithm, if you

1256
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:43,680
want to say the algorithm runs
in quadratic time-- namely

1257
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,100
at least quadratic time, and
at most quadratic time-- then

1258
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:51,166
you'd say t of n is
theta of n squared.

1259
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,292
So let me write that.

1260
01:09:55,190 --> 01:10:04,560
So t of n equals theta
n squared means t grows

1261
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:14,094
quadratically in n-- both
upper and lower bound.

1262
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:15,056
OK?

1263
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:27,690
So for these three guys,
to summarize-- sort of you

1264
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:39,070
can keep track of them pretty
simply-- O means less than

1265
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,030
or equal.

1266
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:43,572
Omega means greater
than or equal.

1267
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,198
Theta means equal up
to constant factors.

1268
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:59,000
Now there's two
more symbols here.

1269
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,622
And they correspond very
naturally to this set-up.

1270
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:05,830
What two symbols are missing
from here that would you

1271
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,650
naturally add to here?

1272
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,150
Yeah.

1273
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,130
Less than and greater than.

1274
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:15,620
So less than is little o.

1275
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,430
Greater than is little omega.

1276
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:24,710
And less than means it's less
than or equal, but not equal.

1277
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,276
And this means greater
than or equal, not equal.

1278
01:11:28,276 --> 01:11:30,150
And let me put them up
over here and give you

1279
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,108
the formal definitions.

1280
01:11:34,852 --> 01:11:35,352
Eraser.

1281
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:52,740
OK.

1282
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,120
So little o.

1283
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,280
as we have f of x
equals little o of g

1284
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:18,310
x if the limit of f of
x over g of x equals 0.

1285
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,810
So f is growing
strictly smaller than g,

1286
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:24,680
so that when I take the
ratio, the limit goes to 0.

1287
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,477
And the reverse is little omega.

1288
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:35,880
And we say that f of x is
little omega-- whoops--

1289
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:42,770
of g of x if this is infinity.

1290
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:46,430
Because now f is growing
strictly faster than g,

1291
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,110
so I take the limit of the
ratio, and it goes to infinity.

1292
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,394
All right so we can do
some simple examples.

1293
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:57,310
Then we're almost done
with all this notation.

1294
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,680
What about this one?

1295
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:16,709
x over ln of x-- we just
looked at it-- and x.

1296
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:18,176
What symbol do I put there?

1297
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,870
What symbol's missing here?

1298
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,060
Little o.

1299
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,890
This grows strictly
smaller than that.

1300
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:31,390
If I took the ratio, and I
took the limit, we got 0.

1301
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,510
So that's a little o.

1302
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,810
OK.

1303
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,340
Is this true?

1304
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,427
x over 100-- is
that little o of x?

1305
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:46,410
No.

1306
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,520
The limit of the
ratio is 1 over 100.

1307
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,590
That's bigger than 0.

1308
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,270
Constants don't matter.

1309
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,770
All right.

1310
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,530
So what symbol would go here?

1311
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,060
Theta goes here.

1312
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,960
Good.

1313
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,310
Also big O and big omega.

1314
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,311
But theta captures everything.

1315
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:01,810
All right.

1316
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,990
What symbol goes here?

1317
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:08,330
x squared equals something x.

1318
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:11,660
What symbol goes there?

1319
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,635
Little omega.

1320
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:14,260
It would also be true
to put big omega,

1321
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,320
but little omega tells you more.

1322
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:21,021
Because the limit of x squared
over x goes to infinity.

1323
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:21,520
OK.

1324
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,760
Any questions
about these things?

1325
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,690
So a natural thing on the
midterm is we do some of that,

1326
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:29,710
for example.

1327
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,410
All right?

1328
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:33,040
And you'll certainly see
some of that on homework.

1329
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,520
You might see some
of that on the test.

1330
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,690
You'll certainly see all
this stuff-- little omega

1331
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:41,020
not very often in 6046 and
later algorithms courses.

1332
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,970
But all the rest
you'll see there.

1333
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,230
Any questions?

1334
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:46,860
All right.

1335
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,760
Now I'm going to
show you something

1336
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,020
that is sort of scary.

1337
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:52,562
Yeah.

1338
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:53,978
AUDIENCE: Why do
you say that it's

1339
01:14:53,978 --> 01:14:55,671
equal to zero when
you said it's less

1340
01:14:55,671 --> 01:15:01,450
than [INAUDIBLE] equals sign.

1341
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,820
PROFESSOR: Which equals?

1342
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,580
AUDIENCE: You said little
omega is less than.

1343
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,296
PROFESSOR: Little omega,
it corresponds to a greater

1344
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:11,650
than, which means a
greater than or equal to,

1345
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:14,840
but not an equal to.

1346
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,510
And the way we can see that
is looking at the definitions

1347
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:25,705
here in the greater than or
equal to is the big omega.

1348
01:15:25,705 --> 01:15:31,850
And that just says
you're bigger than 0.

1349
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:32,350
Ah.

1350
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,280
Let's see.

1351
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,350
All right.

1352
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,680
So I'm bigger than
or equal to is omega.

1353
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:42,970
But I'm not equal
to, which is theta.

1354
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:46,940
So if I know that I'm
this but not that,

1355
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,460
the only conclusion is that
I'm infinity in the ratio.

1356
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:51,960
All right?

1357
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,890
So that's another
way of saying it.

1358
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,940
That's why.

1359
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:56,922
Any other questions?

1360
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,590
All right.

1361
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,048
Now I'm going to
show you something

1362
01:16:02,048 --> 01:16:05,420
that is commonly done, and
that many students will attempt

1363
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,137
to do after seeing
this notation,

1364
01:16:07,137 --> 01:16:08,720
because the notation
is pretty simple.

1365
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,428
Take your limits.

1366
01:16:09,428 --> 01:16:10,900
Everything goes fine.

1367
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,290
Then you start
cruising along with it.

1368
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,490
So now I'm going to show
you how to prove something

1369
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:21,770
that's false using this notation
in a way that people often do.

1370
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:26,700
And the hope is by showing
you, you won't do it.

1371
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,090
It will confuse you,
which is why sometimes we

1372
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,480
worry about showing you.

1373
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:48,420
But let f of i-- f of n-- equal
the sum i equals 1 to n of i.

1374
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:51,600
Now we all know
what that is, right?

1375
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,700
All right.

1376
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:59,456
So I'm going to prove to
you that f of n is O of n.

1377
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:06,460
Now what really-- what
should be here instead of n?

1378
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,980
n squared.

1379
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,090
So n squared can't be O of n.

1380
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:12,000
So this can't be true.

1381
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,500
All right.

1382
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,130
Well let's see how we do it.

1383
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,070
All right.

1384
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:31,280
So the false proof
is by induction on n.

1385
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:39,820
My induction hypothesis is p
of n is going to be that f of n

1386
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,910
is O of n.

1387
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:42,410
All right?

1388
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,020
That's what we, when we want to
prove something by induction,

1389
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,480
typically that's what you do.

1390
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,365
Becomes the
induction hypothesis.

1391
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,531
Let's look at the base case.

1392
01:17:54,690 --> 01:18:03,012
Well f of 1 is 1, and
1 is O of 1 surely.

1393
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:03,850
Right?

1394
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,990
Even 10 was O of 1.

1395
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:07,490
OK.

1396
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:19,920
All right.

1397
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,426
Now we do the inductive step.

1398
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:36,405
We assume p n is true to
prove that p n plus 1 is true.

1399
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:46,850
Well p n means that
f of n is O of n.

1400
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,980
Now I look at f of n plus 1.

1401
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,630
That equals the sum of
the first n plus 1 number.

1402
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:59,640
So that will be f
of n plus n plus 1.

1403
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,000
The induction hypothesis
says this is O of n.

1404
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,620
Clearly this is O of n.

1405
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,830
Well I got O of n plus O of n.

1406
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,385
That's at most twice O of n.

1407
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,630
And constants don't matter.

1408
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,121
So that's O of n.

1409
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:26,520
All right.

1410
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,680
This should begin
to cause panic.

1411
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,900
Is induction wrong?

1412
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,520
What's going on with the big O?

1413
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,350
You will see this
done all the time.

1414
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:40,990
People would do this
kind of an argument.

1415
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:44,430
Looks pretty good, right?

1416
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:48,356
Can anybody see where
I got off track?

1417
01:19:48,356 --> 01:19:49,980
This is a really hard
one to figure out

1418
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,310
where things went wrong.

1419
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:52,254
Yeah?

1420
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,906
AUDIENCE: One of them
might be that you

1421
01:19:53,906 --> 01:20:00,458
might be applying O of n
to numbers which really you

1422
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:05,040
really apply asymptotic
notation to functions.

1423
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,390
PROFESSOR: Great.

1424
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,060
That's a great observation.

1425
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,700
Asymptotic notation only
works for functions.

1426
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,460
Now here when we
say 1 is O of 1,

1427
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,600
well, you could think of it as
f of x being 1-- the function--

1428
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,240
and so forth.

1429
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,480
So that's OK.

1430
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,730
That's a great point.

1431
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:26,999
Now let's figure out using
that how we got in trouble.

1432
01:20:26,999 --> 01:20:28,040
We're not quite done yet.

1433
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,670
That's a great observation.

1434
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,160
But where's the
step that's wrong?

1435
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,590
Oh, no.

1436
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,750
2 times O of n is O of n.

1437
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:43,190
If I have a function that's f
is O of g, twice f is O of g.

1438
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,078
Yeah?

1439
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:47,752
AUDIENCE: It's the end of
n equals 1 [INAUDIBLE].

1440
01:20:47,752 --> 01:20:48,460
PROFESSOR: Is it?

1441
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,371
So what's the problem now?

1442
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:52,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1443
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:56,100
PROFESSOR: Well f of n plus
1-- this statement is true,

1444
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:03,400
because f of n plus 1 is the sum
of i equals 1 to n plus 1 of i.

1445
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,360
That's 1 plus 2 plus
n plus n plus 1.

1446
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,630
And this is f of n.

1447
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,532
So that's OK.

1448
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:19,970
Yeah.

1449
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:24,404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that function.

1450
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:25,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1451
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:28,820
You know, you're getting closer.

1452
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,740
Yeah that's a little
flaky, because I've just

1453
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,950
got a single value
saying it's O of one.

1454
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:38,120
But we sort of argued
before that 10 was O of 1.

1455
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,762
Now realize a function
behind here that matters.

1456
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:41,970
So you're on the right trail.

1457
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,160
But there's an even
bigger whopper hiding.

1458
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:44,984
Yeah.

1459
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1460
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:46,950
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

1461
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:51,130
This is really, really bad.

1462
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,520
All right.

1463
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,770
So now explain to me why this
is really bad what I did here.

1464
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:59,904
AUDIENCE: You didn't need
the function [INAUDIBLE].

1465
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:00,570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1466
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,840
And why isn't-- this
looks like a function.

1467
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,938
Why isn't it a function?

1468
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,740
It's not.

1469
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,450
But it looks like one.

1470
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,760
f of n sure looks like one.

1471
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,128
Why is it not a function when
it's sitting in this thing?

1472
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:19,730
This P of n, right?

1473
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:23,350
Because I've fixed
the value of n here.

1474
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,870
And so this is
now just a scalar.

1475
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:34,020
In fact, you know, I could state
the following-- f of a million,

1476
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,930
right, is O of 1, because
this is really some function H

1477
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:41,930
of x that always is this value.

1478
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,470
So the difference between
a scalar and a function.

1479
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,710
And this is just so nasty
looking, because we see f of n.

1480
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,140
That's a function.

1481
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:54,991
But you can never use
big O in a predicate,

1482
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:56,990
all right, because we've
lost the function here.

1483
01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:00,690
This is just f
valued at n period.

1484
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:03,430
That single instance is
all that's happened here.

1485
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,910
It's not a function anymore.

1486
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:06,790
All right.

1487
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,480
If we had f n of x or
something, that might be OK.

1488
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,540
But there's no function left.

1489
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,040
All right.

1490
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:17,670
So never ever use asymptotic
notation with inductive proofs,

1491
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:20,240
because you will
just invariably stick

1492
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,150
big O into your predicate.

1493
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:27,190
And you could prove all sorts of
false things once you do that.

1494
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,590
OK?

1495
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,150
All right.

1496
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:33,400
Never use asymptotic notation
in induction or predicates.

1497
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,950
Thanks.
