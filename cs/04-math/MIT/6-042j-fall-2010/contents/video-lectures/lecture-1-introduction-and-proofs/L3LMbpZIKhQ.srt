8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,540
PROFESSOR: Who can tell
me what a proof is?

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,459
Any ideas of, what
is a proof, anyway?

10
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:30,000
Any thoughts?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,874
Yeah?

12
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:34,262
AUDIENCE: It's a chain of
statements, each logically

13
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,215
supported by the
previous ones, that

14
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:39,161
get you from a
set of assumptions

15
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:40,730
to a set of conclusions.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,810
PROFESSOR: Very good.

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,640
I like that.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,090
That's very close to what
we're going to do here, yeah.

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,110
Now, that's a special
kind of proof, though.

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,290
That's a mathematical proof.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,170
And I'm going to write
a definition very

22
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,610
close to that in a few minutes.

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,830
But proofs exist
beyond mathematics.

24
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,960
Can anybody think
of a higher level

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,061
notion of what a proof is?

26
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:06,810
That's correct, what
you said, but there's

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,500
a higher meta level notion of
what a proof is beyond that.

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,220
It may have no logical
deductions potentially.

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,490
It may have no assumptions.

30
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,710
Any thoughts about a proof?

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,970
OK, well, I think
generally, a proof

32
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,400
is considered, across
multiple fields,

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,150
as a method for
ascertaining the truth.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,190
And you described one method.

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,720
Now, by ascertaining, I mean
establishing truth, verifying

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,340
truth.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,930
And there's lots of
ways to ascertain truth

38
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,540
in society, and
even within science.

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,050
What are some examples
of ways that we

40
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,395
ascertain truth in society?

41
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,897
Yeah?

42
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,768
AUDIENCE: Observations, like
seeing that piece of chalk

43
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,560
will fall to the ground.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,260
PROFESSOR:
Observation, experiment

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,640
and observation-- excellent.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,540
And that's the
bedrock of physics.

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,580
I mean, who really knows if
there's gravity out there?

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,720
Well, we observe it.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,730
And so we then conclude
that's the truth.

50
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,607
There's gravity, and
we have laws about it.

51
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:34,440
That's one good way.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,890
What's another way
of ascertaining truth

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,830
across scientific disciplines,
or beyond science, just

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,150
in society?

55
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,700
How is truth established?

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,450
What are the ways?

57
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,950
Yeah?

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,704
AUDIENCE: Well,
establishing what's false,

59
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,620
you can know what
things aren't true.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,109
Then that helps you
narrow down what is true.

61
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,900
PROFESSOR: Yes, truth--
yeah, that's great.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,980
Truth is the opposite
of falsehood.

63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,590
How do we establish falsehood?

64
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,460
What are the ways in doing that?

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,455
How you decide something is
not true in every day-- yeah?

66
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,100
AUDIENCE: Find counterexamples.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,460
PROFESSOR: Find counterexamples,
yeah, that's good.

68
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,890
So in fact, even a step
more general, sampling.

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,730
Counterexamples are ways.

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,400
If you do something, an
experiment, ten times,

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,310
and every time, it comes out
one way, that's truth, maybe.

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,329
But there's fields where
that becomes truth.

73
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,245
What about other ways?

74
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,760
How are we going to
decide if Roger Clemens is

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,410
guilty of perjury for lying
about steroids to Congress?

76
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,230
He did it or he didn't.

77
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,300
How are we going to decide that?

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,290
How is that truth going
to be ascertained?

79
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,790
Yeah?

80
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,481
AUDIENCE: Would it be by
examining the evidence

81
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:00,100
that we have?

82
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,350
PROFESSOR: Examining evidence.

83
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,512
And who makes the
conclusion there?

84
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:04,220
AUDIENCE: Juries.

85
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,540
PROFESSOR: The jury.

86
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,645
Truth is established
by juries or judges.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,859
You know, Blago-- I
can never pronounce

88
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,950
his name, the Illinois governor,
Blagojevick-- he's guilty.

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,880
That's the truth of--
not of conspiracy,

90
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,910
trying to sell
Obama a senate seat,

91
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,970
but of lying to the authorities
about campaign financing.

92
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,640
OJ is guilty-- not
of killing his wife,

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,650
but of breaking into an
apartment to steal back

94
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,850
some of his merchandise.

95
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,840
So judges and juries
make decisions on truth.

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,250
What are other truths-- bigger
truths, even, than judges

97
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,085
and juries, in society?

98
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,680
There's one really big one
that causes a lot of issues.

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,180
Yeah?

100
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,870
AUDIENCE: Religion.

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,420
PROFESSOR: What is it?

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,211
AUDIENCE: Religion.

103
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:01,824
PROFESSOR: Religion, the word
of God-- broadly construed here,

104
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:02,365
for religion.

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,140
Now, that one is really
hard to argue about

106
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,750
because you believe it.

107
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,440
And especially if you're
not talking to God regularly

108
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,904
and somebody is, well, it's
hard to argue about the truth.

109
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,820
So you rely on others
to interpret it for you,

110
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,560
often-- a priest, or
a minister, a rabbi.

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,640
And it gets complicated,
because you can end up

112
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,890
with conflicting truths based on
who you think you're talking to

113
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,220
or who the translator
is for you.

114
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,080
Another one is the
word of your boss.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,850
Whatever the boss says is right.

116
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,650
Often in business, the
customer is always right.

117
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,680
That's the truth, whatever
the customer says.

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,920
With Donald Trump as your
boss, you'd better agree

119
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,586
or you're fired.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,110
Often in classes, the
professor says it, it is true.

121
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,910
Because the authority said it.

122
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,290
That's not true here.

123
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,600
That will not hold.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,340
And one of the nicest things
about math that I like a lot

125
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,230
is that the youngest
student can stand up

126
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,020
against the most oldest,
most experienced professor,

127
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,015
and win an argument
on mathematics.

128
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,850
I do get pleasure when a student
comes up and proves me wrong.

129
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,391
I loved it when that
student came in,

130
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,240
and she showed me
what I said really

131
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,090
wasn't right when you
looked at it carefully

132
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,400
or in a different light.

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,230
Now, sometimes if I do it on the
board here and it's in class,

134
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,990
well, that's fun.

135
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,740
I feel a little
embarrassed afterwards.

136
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,640
But it's a good thing
about mathematics,

137
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,550
is you can have that
kind of dialogue.

138
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,200
OK, another one, which is
related to the word of God

139
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,370
sometimes, is inner
conviction-- very popular

140
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,020
in computer science, believe
it or not, with the mantra,

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,820
there are no bugs in my program.

142
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,850
I can't tell you how
many times you hear that.

143
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,790
Closely related is, I don't
see why not something is true.

144
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,940
And that's a good
one, because that

145
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,906
transfers the burden of proof to
anybody who disagrees with you.

146
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:14,910
You don't have to prove.

147
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,550
You just say, I don't
see why it's not true.

148
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,883
All of a sudden, the other
person who's questioning you,

149
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:24,000
it becomes their job to disprove
you, which is not so good.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,710
OK, now in mathematics,
there's this higher level.

151
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,980
And someone stated it
very clearly up there.

152
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,460
Let me write it up here.

153
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:39,280
In mathematics, we have
a mathematical proof

154
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:57,700
is a verification
of a proposition

155
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:16,410
by a chain of logical
deductions from a set of axioms.

156
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,070
Now, that's a bit of a mouthful.

157
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,500
There's three important
components here--

158
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,780
propositions, logical
deductions, and axioms.

159
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,130
And we're going to spend
the rest of the class

160
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,770
today talking about
each of these,

161
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,144
and then give an
example of a proof.

162
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,394
We'll start with propositions.

163
00:08:46,910 --> 00:09:04,000
A proposition is a statement
that is either true or false.

164
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,800
You may not know which one,
but it's one or the other.

165
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,310
A simple example--
2 plus 3 equals 5.

166
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,292
Now, that's a true proposition.

167
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,125
Here's one that's a
little more interesting.

168
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,900
For all n in the set
of natural numbers,

169
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,660
n squared plus n plus
41 is a prime number.

170
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,520
I know I've used
some notation here.

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,465
This is-- the upside down
A is the for all symbol.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,620
How many people have not
seen that symbol before?

173
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,310
A bunch of you.

174
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,110
You're going to see a bunch
of symbols here first week.

175
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,520
And that means for every
possible choice of n--

176
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,010
and this is in the natural
numbers, which is the set 0, 1,

177
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,970
2, 3, and so forth.

178
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,644
It's the natural numbers.

179
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,560
It's basically the
integers, but not negative.

180
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,790
So we're saying for every
natural number, i.e. for 0,

181
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,700
for 1, for 2, and for 3, and
so forth, this expression

182
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,540
is a prime.

183
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,410
Now, a prime number
is a number that

184
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,830
is not divisible by any other
number besides itself and 1.

185
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,850
So 1, 3, 5, 7 are prime.

186
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,890
9 is not because it's 3 times 3.

187
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,700
Now, this part here is
called the predicate.

188
00:10:49,390 --> 00:11:00,420
And a predicate is a
proposition whose truth

189
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:11,090
depends on the value of a
variable-- in this case, n.

190
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,480
All right, this is referred to
as the universe of discourse.

191
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,240
It's the space of all the
things we're talking about.

192
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,230
We're only talking about
natural numbers here.

193
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,140
This is called a quantifier.

194
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,900
We'll see more
quantifiers later.

195
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,820
All right, now to see if
this proposition is true,

196
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,120
we need to make sure
that this predicate is

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,770
true for every natural number n.

198
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,160
So let's see if
we can check that.

199
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,140
Let's try some values.

200
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,230
So we'll try n is 1,
2, 3, and so forth.

201
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,390
And we'll compute n
squared plus n plus 41.

202
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,890
And then we'll
check, is it prime?

203
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,202
So for n equals 0, n squared
plus n plus 41 is 41.

204
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,405
Is 41 prime?

205
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,450
Yeah, nothing divides
41 but itself and 1.

206
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,120
All right, let's try 1.

207
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,845
1 squared plus 1 plus 41 is 43.

208
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,120
Is 43 prime?

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,400
Yes.

210
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,050
Let's try 2.

211
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,440
We get 4 plus 2 is
6 plus 41 is 47.

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,230
Is 47 prime?

213
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

214
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

215
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,200
Looking good.

216
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,640
3-- I got 9, 12, 53.

217
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
Is 53 prime?

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,810
And I could keep on going here.

220
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,550
I could go down to 20.

221
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,140
I get 420-- 461.

222
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,150
In fact, that is a prime.

223
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,410
And I could just
keep on going here.

224
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,460
Go down to 39.

225
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,967
I get 1,601.

226
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:07,550
You can check.

227
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,880
That is a prime.

228
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,120
The first 40 values of n,
the proposition is true.

229
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,700
The predicate is true.

230
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,640
It is prime.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,520
Now, this is a great example
because in a lot of fields--

232
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,560
physics, for example;
statistics, often-- you

233
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
checked 40 examples.

234
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,040
That's above and beyond
the call of duty.

235
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,820
It's always true.

236
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,160
So yeah, this must
be true, right?

237
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,730
No, wrong.

238
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,940
Often, you'll see this in
a lot of scientific fields.

239
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,690
It is not true.

240
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,220
Can anybody give
me an example of n

241
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,750
for which n squared plus
n plus 41 is not prime?

242
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,390
Yeah?

243
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,270
AUDIENCE: 40.

244
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,720
PROFESSOR: 40, good.

245
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Let's see about 40.

246
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,990
40 squared plus 40
plus 41 is 1,681.

247
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,960
What's that equal?

248
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,070
41 squared.

249
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,740
So it is not prime.

250
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,830
Somebody give me an obvious
example where it's not prime.

251
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,530
AUDIENCE: 41.

252
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,330
PROFESSOR: 41--
yeah, 41 squared,

253
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,480
we get everything
is divided by 41.

254
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,990
But 40 is the first break-point.

255
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,110
So the first 40 examples
work, and then it failed.

256
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,570
So this proposition is
false, even though it

257
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,657
was looking pretty good.

258
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:29,990
There's a reason I'm doing this.

259
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,990
In fact, I'm going to
do it some more here.

260
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to beat you
over the head with it.

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,353
Here's a famous in
mathematics statement.

262
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,380
a to the fourth plus b to the
fourth plus c to the fourth

263
00:14:47,380 --> 00:15:01,200
equals d to the fourth has no
positive integer solutions.

264
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,980
That is a proposition.

265
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,160
Now, this proposition was
conjectured to be true by Euler

266
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,740
in 1769.

267
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,570
Euler's a big honcho in math.

268
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,970
We still talk about him
a lot even though he's

269
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,700
been dead for centuries.

270
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,100
It was unsolved for
over 2 centuries.

271
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,890
Mathematicians worked on it.

272
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,280
It was finally disapproved
by a very clever fellow

273
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,090
named Noam Elkies 218 years
later after it was conjectured.

274
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,100
He worked at that other
school down the street.

275
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,200
And he came up with this.

276
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,990
a equals 95,800.

277
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,510
b equals 217,519.

278
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,912
c equals 414,560.

279
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:51,620
You don't have to
remember these numbers.

280
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,217
We're not going to quiz
you on that-- 422,481.

281
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,300
Now, he claims-- I've never
personally checked it,

282
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,360
but presumably, people have--
you plug those in here,

283
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,580
and you have an equality.

284
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,850
So he says.

285
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,340
So in fact, the
correct proposition

286
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,980
is there does exist a, b,
c, d in the positive natural

287
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,000
numbers such that a the fourth
plus b to the fourth plus

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,510
c to the fourth equals
d to the fourth.

289
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,460
I used a new quantifier
here called there exists.

290
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,870
Instead of an
upside down A, it's

291
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,030
a backwards E. Don't ask me why.

292
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,960
That's what it is.

293
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,040
The plus means you can't
have 0 or negative numbers.

294
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,280
So these are the
positive natural numbers.

295
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,080
And here's your predicate, which
of course, the truth of this

296
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,951
depends on the values
of a, b, c and d.

297
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,200
It took a long time to figure
out that actually, there

298
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,817
was a solution here.

299
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,150
Obviously, everything they
tried until that time failed.

300
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,316
Let me give you another one.

301
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:24,085
313 x cubed plus y cubed equals
z cubed has no positive integer

302
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:24,585
solutions.

303
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,850
This turns out to be false.

304
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,580
But the shortest,
smallest counter-example

305
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,950
has over 1,000 digits.

306
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,770
This one was easy.

307
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,650
It only has six digits.

308
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,560
So there's no way ever
you'd use a computer

309
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,600
to exhaustively search
1,000 digit numbers here

310
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
to show it's false.

311
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,810
Now, of course, some of you are
probably thinking, why on earth

312
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,860
would I care if 313 times
x cubed plus y cubed equals

313
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,484
z cubed has a solution?

314
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,150
And that probably
won't be the last time

315
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,310
that thought occurs to
you during the term.

316
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,635
And why on earth
would anybody ever try

317
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:13,320
to even find a solution to that?

318
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,830
I mean, mathematicians
are sort of a rare breed.

319
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,417
Now, actually in
this case, that's

320
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,625
really important in practice.

321
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,280
This equation is an
example of what's

322
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,300
called an elliptic
curve-- elliptic curve.

323
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,820
You study these if you're really
a specialist in mathematics

324
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,030
in graduate school,
or if you work

325
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,770
for certain
three-letter agencies

326
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,140
because it's central to
the understanding of how

327
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,670
to factor large integers.

328
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,760
That means factoring,
showing that-- what was it--

329
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,916
1,681 is 41 times 41.

330
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,380
And I said, OK, who
cares about factoring?

331
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,880
Well, factoring is the
way to break cryptosystems

332
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,625
like RSA, which are
used for everything

333
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,840
that we do electronically today.

334
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,130
You have a Paypal account.

335
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,230
You buy something online.

336
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,710
You're using SSL.

337
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,750
They're all using cryptosystems,
almost all of which

338
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,400
are based on number theory.

339
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,130
And in particular, they're
based on factoring.

340
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,570
And if you can find good
solutions to things like this,

341
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,260
or solutions to things
like this, all of a sudden,

342
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,325
you can get an angle and
a wedge on factoring.

343
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,700
And it's because
of that that now

344
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,940
RSA uses 1,000 digit
moduluses instead of hundred

345
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,844
digit moduluses like
they used to use,

346
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,510
because people figured
out how to factor

347
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,430
and how to break
the cryptosystem.

348
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,490
If you could break
those cryptosystems,

349
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,350
well, you can't rule the
world, but it's close.

350
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,950
All right, so we'll
talk more about this

351
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,830
the week after next when
we do number theory,

352
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,020
and we work up to RSA and
how that cryptosystem works,

353
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,880
and why factoring
is so important.

354
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,537
So yeah, you don't
have to really have

355
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:56,370
to worry about this.

356
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,661
But these things are important.

357
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:01,750
And the bigger message is that
you don't just try a few cases,

358
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,610
and if it works,
you think it's done.

359
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,906
That's not how the game
works in mathematics.

360
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,280
You can get an
idea of maybe it's

361
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,390
true, but doesn't
tell you the answer.

362
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,380
All right, let me
give you another one.

363
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,785
This is another very famous
one that probably most of you

364
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,830
have heard of.

365
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:34,880
The regions in any map can
be colored in four colors

366
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:47,710
so that adjacent regions
have different colors.

367
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,270
Like a map of the
United States--

368
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,860
every state gets a color.

369
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,020
If two states share
a border, they

370
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,430
have different colors so
you can distinguish them.

371
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,530
This is known as the
four color theorem.

372
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,570
And it's very famous in
the popular literature.

373
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,060
How many people have heard
of this theorem before?

374
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah, OK.

375
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,334
So you've all heard of it.

376
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,250
It has a long history.

377
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,240
It was conjectured by somebody
named Guthrie in 1853.

378
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,950
He's the first person to say
this ought to be possible.

379
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,630
And there were many false
proofs over the ensuing century.

380
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,510
One of the most convincing
was a proof using pictures

381
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,700
by Kempe in 1879,
26 years later.

382
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,420
And this proof was
believed for over a decade.

383
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,890
Mathematicians thought
the proof was right

384
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,570
until another mathematician
named Heawood found

385
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,270
a fatal flaw in the argument.

386
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,510
Now, this proof
by Kempe consisted

387
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,204
of drawing pictures of what
maps have to look like.

388
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,620
So he started by
saying, a map has

389
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,953
to look like one of these types.

390
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,620
And he would draw
pictures of them.

391
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,690
And then he argued that those
types that he drew pictures of,

392
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,580
it worked for.

393
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,110
Proofs by picture are often
very convincing and very wrong.

394
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,550
And I'm going to give you one
to start lecture next time.

395
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,133
It'll be a proof by PowerPoint,
which is even worse than proof

396
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,130
by picture.

397
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,971
And it is compelling.

398
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,220
And the point will to be to
show you proofs by picture

399
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,387
are generally not a good thing.

400
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:16,970
Because your brain
just locks in-- oh,

401
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,010
that's what it has to look like.

402
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,510
And you don't think about other
ways that it might look like.

403
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,240
Now, the four color
theorem was finally

404
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,120
proved by Appel
and Haken in 1977,

405
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,970
but they had to use a computer
to check thousands of cases.

406
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,510
Now, this was a little
disturbing to mathematicians,

407
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,989
because how do they know the
computer did the right thing?

408
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:44,780
Your colleague writes
a proof on the board.

409
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,630
You can check it.

410
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,630
But how do you know the
computer didn't mess up,

411
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,130
or not do some cases?

412
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,620
Now, everybody
believes it's true now.

413
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,780
But it's unsatisfying.

414
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,420
A few years ago, a 12-page
human proof was discovered,

415
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,810
but it's not been verified.

416
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,180
And people are very
suspicious of it

417
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,800
because the proof of
the main lemma says,

418
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,740
quote, "details of this
lemma is left to the reader.

419
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,509
See figure seven."

420
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:14,300
That's what the main
lemma of the proof is.

421
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,674
But people think
that maybe there

422
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:19,240
were some good ideas there,
but very suspicious proof.

423
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,430
All right, let's do another
one, another proposition--

424
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,800
also very famous.

425
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:35,490
Every even integer
but 2-- actually,

426
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,875
positive integer but 2--
is the sum of two primes.

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:53,025
For example, 24 is the sum of
11 and 13, which are prime.

428
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,640
Anybody know?

429
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,635
Is this true or false,
this proposition?

430
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,370
Yeah?

431
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,156
AUDIENCE: I wish I knew.

432
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,780
PROFESSOR: [LAUGHS]
Yeah, that's right.

433
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,120
Me too.

434
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,140
Nobody knows if this
is true or false.

435
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,326
This is called
Goldbach's conjecture.

436
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:19,510
It was conjectured by
Christian Goldbach in 1742.

437
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,570
This is a really
simple proposition.

438
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,850
And it's amazing it's not known.

439
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,301
In fact, I spent a couple
years working on-- I thought,

440
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,800
oh, well, this has
to be easy enough

441
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,550
to prove when I was younger,
and didn't get very far.

442
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,010
So people still don't
know if it's true.

443
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,270
And in fact, it was
listed by the Globe

444
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,360
as one of the great
unsolved mysteries.

445
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,310
So if you get out this Globe
article here, one of the hand--

446
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,300
does everybody
have this handout?

447
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,800
You don't?

448
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
We'll get it passed out.

449
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,907
Somebody missing that handout
up over there and over here?

450
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,490
All right, if we get
those passed out.

451
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,260
Now, it lists the
three conjectures.

452
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,610
Do you see Goldbach's
conjecture there?

453
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,240
Now, can anybody
point out something

454
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,509
that's a little disturbing
about what the Globe says

455
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,675
about Goldbach's conjecture?

456
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,980
AUDIENCE: 9 as a prime number.

457
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
gives the example.

458
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,120
Like, instead of
24 is 11 plus 13,

459
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,410
it says 20 is the
sum of 9 and 11.

460
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,860
Now, if we're allowed to
use things like 9 as primes,

461
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,110
Goldbach's conjecture's
pretty easy to prove is true.

462
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,517
This won't be the last
time we get examples

463
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,350
from the literature.

464
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,970
In fact, we're going
to do this a lot,

465
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,381
along this theme of, you cannot
believe everything you read.

466
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:43,130
Now, the Globe is easy
pickings, but we'll

467
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,370
do some more
interesting ones later.

468
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,850
Now, this article lists two
other famous conjectures

469
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:55,440
which most people believe to be
true-- the Riemann hypothesis

470
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,280
after an 1859 paper
written by Bernard Riemann

471
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,740
suggested that zeros in an
infinite series of numbers

472
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,170
known as a zeta function
form along a straight line

473
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,690
on that complex plane.

474
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,350
The hypothesis has been proved
to 1.5 billion zeros, not far

475
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,860
enough to prove it completely.

476
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,660
If they did 1.5
trillion zeros, it

477
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,230
wouldn't be far enough to
prove it completely, of course.

478
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,510
And then the-- no, actually,
the Riemann hypothesis,

479
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,920
a couple years ago,
somebody credible

480
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,150
claimed to have proved it.

481
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,320
Proof turned out
not to be right.

482
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,910
Then there's the
Poincare conjecture.

483
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,570
Now, this one was finished off.

484
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,090
It was proved to be true
in 2003 by a Russian named

485
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,250
Grigori Perelman.

486
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,560
The conjecture says,
roughly speaking,

487
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,180
that 3D objects without
holes, like no a doughnut,

488
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,200
are equivalent to the sphere.

489
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,350
They can sort of be
deformed into a sphere.

490
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,700
This is known to be true in
four dimensions and higher,

491
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,616
but nobody could prove
it for three dimensions

492
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,490
until Perelman came along.

493
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,880
Now, there's a bit of a
controversy around this guy.

494
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,290
He had an 80-page proof, but
didn't have all the details.

495
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,880
So then other teams
of mathematicians

496
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,770
got together and wrote
350 pages of details.

497
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,080
And then most people
believe now that it's right,

498
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,940
and that his original
proof might not

499
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,420
have had all the details, but
he had the right structure

500
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,540
of the proof.

501
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,040
So he won prizes for this.

502
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,090
He won the highest prize in
mathematics, the Fields Medal.

503
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,660
And just earlier this year,
he was awarded the $1 million

504
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,450
Millennium Prize.

505
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,250
And there's about
six problems or so

506
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,750
that if you solve one of them,
the Clay Institute gives you

507
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,690
a million dollars.

508
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,100
And he's the first one to
win the million dollars.

509
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,440
Now, the guy's a little strange.

510
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,820
He rejected the Fields Medal and
refused to go to the ceremony

511
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,350
where he was being honored.

512
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,440
And he's recently rejected
the Millennium prize.

513
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,970
And anyway, this area's
murky, and we have an expert

514
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,929
to explain it all
for us on video,

515
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:57,970
which I thought I'd show.

516
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,550
All right, let's do
a simpler one here.

517
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:19,620
For all n in Z, n greater
than or equal to 2

518
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,240
implies n squared is
greater than or equal to 4.

519
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,060
Now, Z, we use for the integers.

520
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:37,440
And so that would be 0, 1, minus
1, 2, minus 2, and so forth.

521
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,645
And this symbol here is implies.

522
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,100
I In fact, one
thing you can notice

523
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,670
when you read the text is we
use different notation there

524
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,960
as the standard than
I will use in lecture.

525
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,060
And there's lots of
ways of doing it.

526
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,300
You could have a double
arrow, a single arrow.

527
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,000
You could write out
implies every time

528
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
as it's done in the text.

529
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,783
And it doesn't really
matter which one

530
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,700
you want to use as
long as you use one

531
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,630
of the conventions for implies.

532
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,515
And let me define
what implies means.

533
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:43,830
An implication p implies q is
said to be true if p is false

534
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,440
or q is true, either one.

535
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:55,480
So we can write this down
in terms of a truth table

536
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,800
as follows.

537
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,680
You have the values of p and q.

538
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,048
And I'll give the
value of p implies q.

539
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:11,575
If p is true and q is true,
what about p implies q?

540
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:16,330
It's true, because q is
true in the definition.

541
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,594
If p is true and q is false?

542
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:20,260
AUDIENCE: False.

543
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,910
PROFESSOR: False.

544
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,880
P is false.

545
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,610
Q is true.

546
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,190
True.

547
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,440
What about false and false?

548
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,230
It's true.

549
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,760
Even though this is false,
as long as p is false,

550
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,790
p implies q is true.

551
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,520
So this is important
to remember.

552
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,800
False implies anything is true,
which is a little strange.

553
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,880
There's a famous expression.

554
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,819
If pigs could fly,
I would be king.

555
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:56,360
Is that true?

556
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,020
Sort of.

557
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,740
In fact, this
statement, pigs fly

558
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:18,400
implies I'm king-- that's
true, because pigs don't fly.

559
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,420
Doesn't matter whether or
not I'm king, which I'm not.

560
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,010
Since pigs don't fly,
even though that's false,

561
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,414
the implication is true.

562
00:31:27,414 --> 00:31:29,580
Now, some of you have worked
on these things before.

563
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,470
It's second nature.

564
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,190
If you haven't,
you want to start

565
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,100
getting familiar with that.

566
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:37,545
Let's do another example.

567
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,776
What about this proposition?

568
00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,610
For all integers, n in Z, n
greater than or equal to 2--

569
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,350
this is if and only if--
n squared greater than

570
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,890
or equal to 4.

571
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,590
Is that true?

572
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,600
Is n only bigger
than 2 if and only

573
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,030
if n squared is bigger than 4?

574
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,100
It's false.

575
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,490
What's an example of n
for which that's false?

576
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,620
Negative, all right?

577
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,980
So it's false.

578
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,560
n equals negative 3, all right?

579
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,620
Negative 3 squared is
bigger than or equal to 4,

580
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
but negative 3 is not
bigger than or equal to 2.

581
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,670
And in fact this if
and only if means you

582
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,660
have to have an
implication both ways.

583
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,625
So you have to check
both ways for it.

584
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,000
So let's do the truth table--
extend this truth table out

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,340
here to do the truth table
for p if and only if q.

586
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,790
So here are p and q.

587
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,800
Is q implies p
true for this row?

588
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,760
Does true imply true?

589
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah.

590
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,891
False implies true?

591
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:22,120
That's true.

592
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,570
True does not apply false.

593
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,160
That's false.

594
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,660
And false implies false.

595
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,500
And so now, we can see
where p is if and only if q.

596
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,860
If they're both true,
then it's true here.

597
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,660
What about here?

598
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,670
Is p true if and only if
q is true in this case?

599
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,190
No, because p implies q is
false, but q implies p is true.

600
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,980
So it's false.

601
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,730
False here.

602
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,490
I made a mistake there, right?

603
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,070
That was true-- oops.

604
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,900
And true if and
only if true, OK.

605
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,240
They're both true, so we're OK.

606
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,260
So p if and only if q is
true when they're both true

607
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,499
or both false.

608
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:10,744
And that's it.

609
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,889
If they're different,
then it's not true.

610
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,860
The key here is to
always check both ways.

611
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,139
So if you're asked to
prove an if and only if,

612
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,037
you have to prove that
way, and that way.

613
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,239
We've just done about
15 propositions.

614
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,620
Is every sentence a proposition?

615
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,570
Yes?

616
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,388
No?

617
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:37,929
AUDIENCE: No.

618
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,512
PROFESSOR: No.

619
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:41,240
What's an example of something
that's no a proposition?

620
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,659
AUDIENCE: This
statement is false.

621
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,409
PROFESSOR: A what?

622
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,420
AUDIENCE: This
statement is false.

623
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,719
PROFESSOR: This
statement is false.

624
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,590
That's true.

625
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,020
Well, it's true it's
not a proposition.

626
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,971
Because if it were true,
it wouldn't be false.

627
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:55,429
And if was false,
then it'd be true

628
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,909
and you'd have a contradiction.

629
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,850
So it's neither true nor false.

630
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,579
What's a more simple
example of something

631
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:01,620
that's not a proposition?

632
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,069
AUDIENCE: This is a tissue.

633
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:05,484
Isn't that a [INAUDIBLE]?

634
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:06,940
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

635
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,470
Boy, I would have said
that's true in some world.

636
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,214
Because yeah, that's a tissue.

637
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:14,255
So it's a true statement.

638
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,670
AUDIENCE: Hello.

639
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,641
PROFESSOR: Hello.

640
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:19,140
That's good.

641
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,590
That's neither true
or false, yeah.

642
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,720
A question.

643
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,080
Who are you-- neither
true nor false.

644
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,000
So not everything
is a proposition.

645
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,750
But in this course,
pretty much everything

646
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,620
we deal with will
be a proposition.

647
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,166
All right, so that's
it for propositions.

648
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,415
Any questions on propositions?

649
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,315
Next, we're going to
talk about axioms.

650
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,660
Now, the good news is that
axioms are the same thing,

651
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,920
really, as propositions.

652
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,130
The only difference is that
axioms are propositions

653
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,470
that we just assume are true.

654
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:16,470
An axiom is a proposition
that is assumed to be true.

655
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,570
There's no proof that
an axiom is true.

656
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,740
You just assume it because
you think it's reasonable.

657
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,430
In fact, the word
"axiom" comes from Greek.

658
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,250
It doesn't mean to be true.

659
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,180
It means to think
worthy-- something

660
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,950
you think is worthy enough
to be assumed to be true.

661
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,780
Now, a lot of times, you'll hear
people say-- sometimes, we'll

662
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,000
even say it to you--
don't make assumptions

663
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,150
when you're doing math.

664
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,774
No, that's not true.

665
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,690
You have to make assumptions
when you do math.

666
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,570
Otherwise, you can't
do anything because you

667
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,900
have to start with some axioms.

668
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,240
The key in math is to identify
what your assumptions are

669
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,450
so people can see them.

670
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,350
And the idea is that
when you do a proof,

671
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,634
anybody who agrees with your
assumptions or your axioms

672
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:07,550
can follow your proof.

673
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,660
And they have to agree
with your conclusion.

674
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,210
Now, they might disagree
with your axioms,

675
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,810
in which case, they're not
going to buy your proof.

676
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,020
Now, there are lots of
axioms used in math.

677
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:31,670
For example, if a equals b and
b equals c, then a equals c.

678
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,250
There is no proof of that.

679
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,090
But it seems pretty good.

680
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,580
And so we just throw it in the
bucket of axioms and use it.

681
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:47,210
Now, axioms can be contradictory
in different contexts.

682
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,340
Here's a good example.

683
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:56,220
In Euclidean geometry,
there's a central axiom that

684
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:11,420
says given a line L
and a point p not on L,

685
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:22,090
there is exactly one
line through p parallel

686
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:31,280
to L. You all saw this in
geometry in middle school,

687
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,020
right?

688
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,228
You've got a point in a line.

689
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,160
There's exactly another
line through the point

690
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,220
that's parallel to the line.

691
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,600
Now, there's also a field
called spherical geometry.

692
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,820
And there, you have an
axiom that contradicts this.

693
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,220
It says, given a line L
and a point p not on L,

694
00:38:52,220 --> 00:39:01,840
there is no line through p
parallel to L on the sphere.

695
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:09,270
There's a field called
hyperbolic geometry.

696
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,190
And there, there's
an axiom that says,

697
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,800
given a line L and
a point p not on L,

698
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:26,632
there are infinitely many
lines through p parallel to L.

699
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:27,690
So how can this be?

700
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,870
Does that mean one of these
fields is totally bogus,

701
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,620
or two of them are?

702
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,470
Because they've got
contradictory axes.

703
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,860
That's OK.

704
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,230
Just whatever field you're
in, state you're axioms.

705
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,610
And they do make sense
in their various fields.

706
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,794
This is planar geometry.

707
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:44,710
This is on the sphere.

708
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,880
And this is on
hyperbolic geometry.

709
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,990
They make sense
in those contexts.

710
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,750
So you can have more or less
whatever axioms you want.

711
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,070
There are sort of two
guiding principles to axioms.

712
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,305
Axioms should be-- it's called
consistent-- and complete.

713
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:39,880
Now, a set of
axioms is consistent

714
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:48,300
if no proposition can be proved
to be both true and false.

715
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,640
And you can see why
that's important.

716
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,120
If you spend three weeks
proving something's true,

717
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,880
and the next day, somebody
proves it's also false,

718
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,020
I mean, the whole
thing was pointless.

719
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,630
So it only makes sense if
your axioms, as a group,

720
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,140
are consistent.

721
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:26,610
A set of axioms is
said to be complete

722
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:35,800
if it can be used to
prove every proposition is

723
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,060
either true or false.

724
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,930
Now, this is desirable
because it means-- well,

725
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,450
you can solve every problem.

726
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,314
Everything is-- you
can prove it's true,

727
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,480
or you can prove it's false.

728
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,010
You can get to the end.

729
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:05,280
Now, you'd think
it shouldn't be too

730
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,230
hard to get a set of axioms
that satisfies these two

731
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,730
basic properties.

732
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,490
You're allowed to choose
whatever you want, really.

733
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,990
Just, you don't want to be
creating contradictions.

734
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,762
And you want a set
that's powerful enough

735
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:18,970
that allows you to prove
everything is true or false,

736
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,740
one of the two.

737
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,350
Turned out not to be
so easy to do this.

738
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,800
And in fact, many logicians
spent their careers--

739
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,700
famous logicians--
trying to find

740
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,130
a set of axioms,
just one set, that

741
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,529
was consistent and complete.

742
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,320
In fact, Russell and
Whitehead are probably

743
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,820
the two most famous.

744
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,080
They spent their entire
careers doing this,

745
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,270
and they never got there.

746
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,570
Then one day, this guy
named Kurt Godel showed up.

747
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,940
And in the 1930s, he
proved it's not possible

748
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,060
that there exists any
set of axioms that are

749
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,450
both consistent and complete.

750
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,560
Now, this discovery
devastated the field.

751
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,270
It was a huge discovery.

752
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,670
Imagine poor Russell
and Whitehead.

753
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,035
They spent their entire careers
going after this holy grail.

754
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:09,660
Then Kurt shows up
and said, hey, guys.

755
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,580
There's no grail.

756
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,910
It doesn't exist.

757
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,580
And that's a little
depressing-- pretty bad day

758
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,840
when that happened.

759
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,000
Now, it's an amazing
result, because it

760
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,600
says if you want consistency--
and that's a must--

761
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,630
there will be true facts
that you will never

762
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,052
be able to prove.

763
00:43:26,052 --> 00:43:27,510
We're not going to
prove that here.

764
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,210
It's proved in a logic course.

765
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,740
For example, maybe
Goldbach's conjecture is true

766
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,960
and it is impossible to prove.

767
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,810
Now, we're going to
try not to assign any

768
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,210
of those problems for homework.

769
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,182
And in fact, they do exist.

770
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:42,890
It's complicated.

771
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,432
You can state a problem that you
can't prove is true or false.

772
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:49,390
And you may be thinking
that from time to time.

773
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,348
Hey, it's one of those.

774
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,140
Remember when your parents told
you if you work hard enough,

775
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,270
you can do anything?

776
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,890
They were wrong.

777
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,270
All right, that's
enough for now.

778
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,020
And we'll do more
of this next time.
